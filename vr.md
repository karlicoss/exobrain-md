    4. Myo
    Sooo you’re walking around a virtual world and your mind is being blown. Eventually you’re going to want to reach out and interact with it. The Myo controllers are your in-game fine motor skills. 

hmm could use it for kinda mouse? that'd be pretty cool, basically controlling mouse without moving hands from the keyboard  




## `[2019-02-01]` shit, discontinued&#x2026;




# wonder if I could represent timeline somehow      [[memex]] [[timeline]]




# Render 4d sphere      [[viz]]

Maybe make an online game where you have to guess the radius (you can leave markers)  
Basically the idea is you can mark the pole and walk around it  
Kinda binary search!

ok, that's pretty interesting, they demonstrate parallel transport

    Don’t forget if you install Virtual Desktop you can play all your PCVR games wirelessly on it too. I play HL Alyx like this and it’s flawless.
