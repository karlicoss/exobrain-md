## `[2020-03-22]` Reddit's Save Functionality Sucks | My Random Thoughts by Cedric Amaya      [[reddit]] [[exports]]

<https://cedric.tech/blog/reddits-save-functionality-sucks/>  

    For those unaware, saving things on Reddit as a non-Premium member works in the following way:
        limited to 1000 saved things (posts and comments) total; once the limit is reached, older things are replaced and essentially deleted from history
        saves are stored in reverse chronological order (latest to oldest)
        no way whatsoever to filter or sort saved content
        no searching capability is provided
        pagination limit on Reddit site is limited to 25 items, thus requiring users to use the “Next Page” or “Prev Page” buttons a lot

wow, the fuck?? they are deleted from history??

## `[2020-02-15]` <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22177077>      [[reddit]]

    I'm tackling the issue of managing Reddit saves.
    Across all platforms (not just Reddit), people including myself like to save/bookmark interesting content in the hopes of getting some use out of it later.
    The problem arises when you start accumulating too much content and forget to ever check that stuff out.

    Because our memacs-modules run automatically, it would be difficult to be notified in case of an error.
    So memacs-modules handle errors by appending them to a file:

Very nice pattern, could use it for other stuff too

maybe it's fine to make the program super customizable, just guard it (and make sure the minimal setup runs smoothly)

# demo: materialistic app      [[toblog]] [[orger]] [[materialistic]]

Hi, this yet another demo of Orger and today I want to show how I'm using it to process my Hackernews bookmarks.  

So, on my Andoird phone I'm using this app, called Materialistic.  
It's a nice, clean, open source. It cache articles for offline, so I quite like it.  

But, one downside is that the list of saved items its not synchronised with your Hackernews account.  
That is, it only keeps saved articles locally on the phone.  

I guess the main reason is because Hackernews doesn't have an API. So if the developers were to implement saving functionality,  
they would have to use web scraping etc, which is tedious. But anyway, that's not the point.  
Because even if it sync, your save items list on hackernews is static.  
You can't reorder it, you can't prioritize it, you can't add some comment or annotation.  

(TODO show screenshot)  

And I'm saving a lot of links, and I don't have enough time to read all of them.  

So.. and let me show how Orger helps with this.  
TODO jump to the file  
So as you can see I've already got some stuff organized. For now let's jump to the end, where new saved items are added.  
It's easy to spot items that are new, since they don't have a priority yet.  
So what I would normally do is &#x2013; I would check out this file, perhaps once it couple of weeks.  

First, I'm going through new items, and putting a priority on each of them from A to D, just based on the title.  
TODO so for example (show examples of items the I want to read now, hence put A, and unlikely, so put D)  

Once I've done that, I can sort everything. So we can select everything. and call org-sort-entries, and choose 'prioirity'  
And &#x2013; whoops, you can see it's put the highest priority stuff on the top.  

So I've got like, two articles marked as A, which I can read right now.  
Sometimes I would also go through the items marked as B/C and once again, top up the prirority, sort, and here you go.  
That way you can process the most important and relevant stuff and keep up to your content queue.  

One question people often ask &#x2013; if you admit you will probably never have time to read everything, why don't you just remove stuff with the lowest priority.  

Two ansers: 1 &#x2013; sometimes I might go throught them and top up the priority. TODO priorities change, etc., so I might be TODO to read this later.  

The second answer &#x2013; it's useful for search. So I might not necessarily read the item directly. But I've got a global search over all of my information.  

TODO demonstrate, for example.  

I'm using similar TODO for reddit.  
And you can set it up for pretty much anything similar.  

TODO demonstrate on global search for 'Database Schema'?  

TODO set (setq frame-title-format "%b") in emacs for presentation mode  

TODO at the end of video demonstrate HPI?? and the command running in cron?  
TODO the script running on phone? &#x2026; not sure&#x2026;  
but could show a snippet I guess  
crontab -l | grep materialistic, etc

link to HPI?  




# github comments      [[orger]]





## `[2019-09-18]` need to publish github<sub>provider</sub> first?..




# reddit grabber &#x2013; prevents deleted posts




# Permanent view onto reddit bookmarks.. hard to distinguish between unfavorited or nonexistent though      [[reddit]] [[exports]]

-   State "STRT"      from "TODO"       `[2019-03-15]`




# I guess id want to rearrange items based on topics and probably threads/posts      [[reddit]] [[org]]

Also would make it really easier to prioritize etc  




# plaintext mirror of your digital self      [[orger]]




# Every bookmark manager ever made      [[pkm]] [[orger]]

    Every bookmark manager ever made - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21744774

People wonder why are bookmarks so hard  




## `[2020-01-17]` ediscoverability

    My issue with all bookmark managers, including the one I currently use (Larder.io), is re-discoverability. I will happily bookmark this and that, but it's unlikely I'll ever actually go back to the bookmark. Every once in a while I'll go through the library when I feel like looking for random gems, but the first port of call when trying to solve a problem will always be a search engine.




# Post about reading Reddit. Need Reddit provider for that though&#x2026; Could just extract a separate script for saved      [[orger]]




# hypothesis view?      [[coding]] [[org]]

-   State "DONE"       from "STRT"      `[2019-03-15]`
-   State "STRT"      from "TODO"       `[2019-03-12]`




## `[2019-03-02]` for hyp:

original url with timestamp  
page comments  
each item is a note with possibly a comment  
tags?  
transformations? Could actually be generic across the whole provider. need a decent way of applying them though  




## how to make everything is consumed?? would be interesting thing for jsons.

basically wrap every node and assert it's expanded?  




### `[2019-03-15]` I guess could do that for tests only.. since often attribute retrieval is lazy..




## `[2019-03-02]` ok, let's think what do we want





### `[2019-03-02]` also not sure about append only&#x2026; that's pretty tricky

I guess on the slightest parsing weirdness it should refuse to do anything  
for now, start with read only I suppose  




### `[2019-03-15]` rely on emacs lock files? perhaps there is some library which can handle that for other text editors?


-   `[2019-09-17]` didn't find any good lib




### `[2019-03-15]` I guess I could also just track state. that way appending would make more sense. perhaps even different files for all reddit bookmarks and my view which I am manipulating..

I guess that's the way to go, yep
