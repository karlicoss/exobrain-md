# \* motivation





## There are lots of cool links which I might never get to explore

However I did spend time 'curating' them, so perhaps they could serve as a kick off point for someone else  




## why? 

delegate link processing to the outside world. Maybe someone runs into them and gets inspired #extendedmind  




## basically explain, which stuff I maintain and which stuff I keep as a dump. seems like a good compromise




## `[2020-04-13]` [Tanami/websights: Just a personal web directory of stuff that I want to keep in my head.](https://github.com/Tanami/websights)

    my theory: all people eventually reach the point where they accrue enough debris that it becomes necessary to distribute it in order to move forward with their thinking

yes, so much this  




## so I want a personal wiki similar to what Nikita Voloboev got, but with org-mode      [[blog]] [[pkm]]

gitbook has got nice almost realtime search but only supports markdown. also they are not open source?  

<https://github.com/qdot/org-gitbook> &#x2013; weird thing, split my headings into different pages  
had to package-install ox-gfm first  

-   `[2019-12-02]` dunno, maybe starting with single page with links dump (sorted by tags then date?) and that wouldn't even require index?  
    ignore priorities at first?
-   `[2019-12-02]` one simple thing to do would be just generating html pages (with normal emacs export?) and then running JS indexer against HTML pages? could do when blog is compiled

tedious to upgrade though, but a good start?  

-   `[2019-12-03]` maybe, display everything as a single page, then it's easy to search?




### `[2019-12-03]` related: is there plugin for fuzzy/stemming search in firefox?      [[search]] [[browsers]]




## `[2021-01-16]` even if it's just a very raw dump, chances are someone might run into them while googling or searching on github




# \* current implementation

via native emacs org-mode export, see <https://github.com/karlicoss/exobrain-compiler/blob/master/src/build.py>  




## `[2020-01-03]` Mirror org-org export, It could be public, under version control and allow for privacy controls      [[pkm]]




## `[2020-11-15]` [logseq/logseq: A privacy-first, open-source platform for knowledge sharing and management.](https://github.com/logseq/logseq)      [[logseq]]

figuring it out as an extra interface, and for the graph  




## maybe each page got main content, and then just related links/highlights below?




## `[2020-12-15]` [Emacs Org-mode: Use good header ids!](https://writequit.org/articles/emacs-org-mode-generate-ids.html)      [[blog]] [[org]] [[linkrot]]




## `[2020-12-15]` [UOMF: Linking Headings](https://karl-voit.at/2019/11/16/UOMF-Linking-Headings/)

    So I kept using :ID:.




## def ned quick capture.. and then maybe dispatch items via tags      [[org]]




## need to support self tags in TOC? when I specify custom TOC header they don't seem to work, shit.




## do not emit empty <tag> and nbsp??      [[org]]




## trying to use org-ql, but not sure if it's that good for tag cloud

maybe useful for tag summaries?  

    '--directory', root_dir / 'src/org-ql',
    '--directory', root_dir / 'src/ts.el',
    '--directory', root_dir / 'src/peg',
    '--eval', f'''
    (progn
    (message "%s" (org-ql "{input_dir}/memex.org" "memex"))
    )
    '''.strip(),




## scrolling org-mode into active in the sidebar

from mdbook  

    // Scroll sidebar to current active section
    var activeSection = document.getElementById("sidebar").querySelector(".active");
    if (activeSection) {
        // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView
        activeSection.scrollIntoView({ block: 'center' });
    }




## on tag click &#x2013; search over all tags




## maybe group by tags? could even do it via orgparse




## output links (at least the ones with tags) to pinboard?

might need a two-step process for a proper diff  




## not sure what to do about filetags?




## `[2021-01-04]` make public generated files read only?




## maybe generate TITLE, set to filename (so logseq doesn't stumble over it)      [[logseq]] [[org]]




# \* alternative ways to build it





## `[2019-12-22]` ok, ox-hugo generates some odd artifacts, perhaps would be easier with vanilla md export      [[blog]]




## `[2020-02-14]` Building a Second Brain in Roam&#x2026;And Why You Might Want To : RoamResearch <https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/eho7de/building_a_second_brain_in_roamand_why_you_might>




## `[2020-03-11]` [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

hmm, looks pretty nice. wonder if it's better than mdbook  




## try publishing with dendron and publish in discord?





### `[2021-01-16]` it's very cool, but similar problems to mdbook &#x2013; if it's not mardown in the first plays, gonna be a lot of work to maintain org->md conversion, and nothing beats emacs




## `[2019-12-22]` Markbook - A replacement for Gitbook/mdBook written in Node.js : javascript

<https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/b68k3v/markbook_a_replacement_for_gitbookmdbook_written/>  

    I regarded Gitbook as a FOSS traitor, since it has all but abandoned it's open-source tool for a proprietary web app.




### `[2020-03-06]` it's a new project, not sure what's the benefit over mdbook




## seems that github codespaces would be perfect for it?

I guess I need to get rid of the filter thing? not sure. Would be nice to commit directly into my notes  




## `[2020-11-05]` [Org Mode - Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c3800271-dd56-46fb-8de7-e850f3c006b7.html)

## split hunks by org outlines somehow?      [[git]] [[org]]




## maybe tag-based exporting? export/noexport tags for hieriarchies/whole files? let it be a mess with one huge page?




## write a tool to analyse tags      [[tagging]] [[pkm]]

-   the tags that are the most common, deserve pages
-   rest are okay to keep adhoc?
-   custom agendas for tags (top level only?)
-   search is really important..

# `[2021-01-23]` graph      [[logseq]]

-   repulsive force: charges (forceManyBody)  
    -   distanceMin is interesting (e.g. set to 1000000). pushes unrelated stuff far, but it ends up clumping
    -   distanecMax &#x2013; if I lower it, it ends up clumping + some circular artifacts (although they might be intesting too!)
    -   strenght: setting to something like -400 effectively has the same effect as default zoom? they are just a bit more spread apart  
        ok, -200 is good enough
-   attractive force: forceLink  
    
        return 1 / Math.min(count[link.source.index], count[link.target.index]);
    
    -   defaultStrenght: low value makes it appear like a blob
    -   defaultStrength: smth like 10 completely breaks the simulation?
    -   changing min to max results in 'leafy' nodes pushed very far apart
    -   adding Math.pow(count, 2) &#x2013; weird. I guess pow has similar effect and reduces the force effectively
    -   changing distance to large values &#x2013; again, weird cicrular artifacts??  
        I guess it's sort of an 'expected distance'? and at some point it's dominated by the repulsion anyway. default 30 is good enough

    There is certainly beauty in randomness.
    
    How about an option which presents you a visualisation of a set of random connections in the daily notes (as a link to a new data visualisation page)? Maybe with options to turn on and off certain branches of thought (in cases you are working on something specific). This way you get your daily inspiration right in your daily notes (or you can turn it off if you don't like it).
    
    Ultimately, it would be very unique if these random connections also generate a page with all block and page references to the visualised links. Basically you forgo the problem of an empty page, not knowing where to start.
    
    I am a Social Scientist and my daily bread and butter is to synthesise knowledge, reproduce it, change it and generate new knowledge. However, most importantly, use that knowledge to have an impact in non-academic contexts (where it matters the most, I think).
