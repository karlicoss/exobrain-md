Timeline is a simple attempt to display various life events as list. Sort of a simplistic #memex.  




# Rationale       [[timeline]]





## `[2018-08-06]` It is useful to answer the question 'what were you doing' lately. Both to other people and yourself




## `[2018-08-06]` I need better activity log to tell people about stuff. Hypothesis, goodreads, youtube




## use it for some sort of spaced repetition for the previous week/month?      [[spacedrep]]

-   motivation: helps to reflect what you've been doing and thinking
-   implementing: need some automatic jumping onto last week's entry? or manually is fine

    Chronicle is another personal tool I created in an effort to better understand and know myself. It creates a timeline UI from text based data using @neauoire's tablatal format and parser.

huh, very nice encoding ('encrypting'?) to make data appear private while keeping timeline reasonable  
<https://github.com/Rostiger/chronicle>  




## `[2021-02-09]` <https://rostiger.github.io/chronicle>

whoa very nice interface (different 'tracks' for different contexts)  
could have  

-   environment context
-   location context
-   'acitivity' context
-   body state context (like sleeping?)

however I'm not sure about HTML, probably infeasible? although by-month + last month would be kinda ok  
guess the code isn't that complicated though

    Kudos - this looks like a great project and is fully usable now.
    I have a similar project, DL, that's unfinished. Mine revolves around using a custom API in both Rust and REST to aggregate all my digital life events using ActivityStreams 2.0 and extensions to that, in a manner that is decentralized and ranked/categorized through machine learning. I am still working on it and releasing it Open Source is one of this year's goals.
    My motivation is that the amount of information I receive from Twitter,Mastodon,Facebook,Reddit,HN,various Stack exchanges,blog postings,etc. has gotten to the point where it's too easy to miss things.
    Jeremie Miller, one of the creators of XMPP, had something similar revolving around the Telehash protocol. As far as I can tell, that effort is discontinued, or at least no longer Open Source.

    The Database that Syncs!
    PouchDB is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by Apache CouchDB that is designed to run well within the browser.
    PouchDB was created to help web developers build applications that work as well offline as they do online.
    It enables applications to store data locally while offline, then synchronize it with CouchDB and compatible servers when the application is back online, keeping the user's data in sync no matter where they next login.




## `[2019-08-18]` hmm. could use for timeline? If it keeps items in database, then I can just rely on it and implement pagination?

    However, you also need to take into account that tables can't begin rendering without being completely received, because the table width may change depending on what content is put in it. Additionally, you can't render the next row until the previous one is rendered (otherwise you will either go too large or too small - both cases will cause the page to look off).
