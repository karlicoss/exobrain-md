# \* Logseq      [[logseq]]

[Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq#logseq) is a #localfirst browser interface for #org (mode). I'm using it for my #exobrain  




## search could be wider and include more stuff?      [[exobrain]]




## suggestions 





### `[2020-12-30]` display 'current' graph without clicking on 'page graph' all over again?      [[outbox]]




### `[2020-12-30]` hmmm&#x2026; I'd like to see 'related' pages, e.g. when certain tags are siblings?

<https://discord.com/channels/725182569297215569/725182570131751005/746244953910411324>  
maybe <https://github.com/logseq/logseq/issues/207>  




### `[2020-12-30]` eh. singe page (toexobrain export) didn't quite work well

-   relativize links in index.html? then easier to use as a single page app without selfhosting
-   graph doesn't seem to work

-   `[2020-12-30]` ok, try switching abs paths to relative




## might be nice to have several 'layers'      [[exobrain]]

e.g. people could be on a different layer  
it could be achieved by having them not participate in constraints and just layed out on top with different color?  




## `[2020-12-29]` [Publishing](https://logseq.github.io/page/publishing)      [[logseq]] [[exobrain]]

ok, nice, this worked (need to run http server though, doesn't work as a fully static page?)  




## dev mode suggesion: reindex on refreshed code (or force reindex)      [[outbox]]




## node size proportional to the number of links?      [[exobrain]] [[logseq]]




## hmm, if title is missing, might be better to use filename (now it's picking the first heading)      [[exobrain]]




## if it used custom ids would be awesome..




## need a mode to exclude headings from notes graph? although not sure      [[exobrain]]

e.g. I want two tags to be connected if they are siblings &#x2013; basically only want connections between tags? I guess it's kinda subjective  




## colour differently pages with the corresponding file and without (i.e. tags)      [[logseq]] [[exobrain]]




## `[2021-01-07]` [logseq/graph.cljs at 14e4af295781a00aacdb9104bda9c8121000b2cb · logseq/logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/blob/14e4af295781a00aacdb9104bda9c8121000b2cb/src/main/frontend/handler/graph.cljs#L112)      [[logseq]]

    (map (fn [[p aliases]]

aliases for graph view  




## auto push could push on a separate branch? and the actual normal push could be manual?      [[logseq]]




## `[2021-01-08]` right, it treats # as tags?      [[org]]




## need to highlight connections when I drag the enode      [[logseq]] [[exobrain]]




## ignore tags: read watch inspiration motivation buy outbox ? maybe even study? they result in too many connections

maybe they are more like attributes.. or tiny dots around tag, each of dots represents a task. dunno  




## `[2021-01-18]` [logseq/config.cljs at master · logseq/logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/blob/master/src/main/frontend/config.cljs#L18)




## `[2020-12-30]` [Directory handle not exists (local filesystem) · Issue #918 · logseq/logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/issues/918)




## do not parse tags in quoted text      [[logseq]]




## `[2020-12-30]` [using heading as title](https://discord.com/channels/725182569297215569/725182570131751005)      [[logseq]]

    Yeah, there're some users who rely on the first heading as the page title.
    If you prefer to use the file name as the page title instead of the first heading's title, (TITLE -> filename -> first heading), add :page-name-order "file" to the file logseq/config.edn.




## wtf??       [[logseq]]

only seems to happen in publishing mode?  

    Lookup ref should contain 2 elements: ({:page/name "pkm"})




## ask for publishing from console      [[logseq]]

would also help for testing.. in a way?  




# \* Orgzly      [[orgzly]]

Awesome android app for #orgmode  
<https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android>  

so, every notebok has a root node  
unspecified: inserts at the end of root?  

note level; level 0 is root  




## debugging `SQLiteDatabase: /data/user/0/com.orgzly/databases/orgzly_test.db`




## feat: interface for fs browsing

The main issue is multiple repositories  
Imagine we have  
repo1:  
  dir  
     file1.org  
repo2:  
  dir  
     file2.org  
we'll have to somehow merge them. Quite annoying!  




## feat: open org files in orgzly      [[org]]

karlicoss/orgzly branch view-org-files  

right, so apparently, notes are getting rebuilt every time from database  
we could have a temporary database which gets flushed occasionally and never gets displayed?  
<https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android/issues/148>  




### Wonder if i could implement simple org viewer with org-java?      [[org]] [[android]]


-   `[2018-11-20]` eh, tbh I don't need it that often. I usually use docsearch (or could use recoll!)




## <https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android/issues/345>       [[spacedrep]]




## feat: capture templates? With screen buttons

-   State "STRT"      from "TODO"       `[2019-02-21]`

<https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android/issues/80>  




### `[2019-02-21]` shit. gradle sync didn't work. tried updating Kotlin but that didn't help&#x2026;




### `[2019-02-21]` basic idea: first approximation &#x2013; reuse widget for notebook, just trigger note creation on opening

we want  
name, template, target (could be file in the first approximation, but think how we would address subheadings)  

-   how would that work with sync?

-   how do we handle staling targets?




### `[2019-02-24]` <https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android/pull/466>




## Orgzly notification high priority only? Or even a search query

<https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android/issues/245>  




### you know if anyone started progress on that? If not I might give it a try.

I'm not aware of any. That would be great, thanks.  
I guess it would be a new preference in Settings / Reminders that can contain a search query?  




## bug: cut note and then create new in an empty notebook &#x2013; the note you cut disappears




## Orgzly quick search widget?

## `[2020-07-11]` [orgzly/orgzly-android] Detect org files in subfolders

    I switched from orgzly to markor exactly because of the lack of this feature. Yes, I know, these apps differs a lot, but I use them simply as a text editor. I'm still waiting when this will become available in orgzly. Why it's so hard to implement it?

## `[2020-04-12]` issue with Out of sync items/ sync stuck at 99%

not sure what exactly caused it, but basically was constantly showing local/global state mismatch  
Rest api is on GUI port, key is in advanced settings  
<https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/rest.html>  
use the post request to reset the index (apparently no way from GUI)

-   `[2021-05-02]` happened again, reset just one folder, was fine after that

### `[2020-12-19]` eh? apparently it's already presetn? <https://github.com/kozec/syncthing-gtk/issues/261>

interesting..  




## ok, syncthing paranoid should simply reuse logic in cloud-heartbeat      [[cloud]]

also probably belongs to the same repository altogether  




## had a bug: in pkm dir      [[cloud]]

TODO would be interesting to do fuzzing  

1.  before pkm (real dir) pkm/search (symlink) pkm/swoop (symlink)

UNSYNCED!  

1.  after pkm: symlink with the same files inside

sync was just stuck  




## Better indicator for syncthing? In mc and in gui?

Gui &#x2013; available, mc &#x2013; not sure how..  
mm, doesn't look like there is a nice terminal interface?

### `[2019-04-17]` also allow selective syncing on mobile/wifi




## `[2019-06-05]` shit, weird. syncthing has got some sort of mismatch between GUI and web file/folder count; borg was showing differnt counts as well (script in dropbox that I used to check for differences)      [[cloud]]

## wip on DSL issue

    > Usually I prefer DSLs embedded in a Turing-complete language to provide the TC escape hatch if needed, but here that's precisely what we don't want.
    
    TODO why no escape hatch
    
    I'm (as a somewhat experienced programmer) biased towards having a real programming language, because, because I've struggled with mediocre yaml/json DSL that end up reimplementeing half of the programming language in an incomrehensible ways. E.g. if you already know javascript, you end up frustrated with expressing in DSL what you'd otherwise have don in few lines of code. And the opposite: if you don't know how to program in the first place I'd be much rather
    
    debugging somethine like
    
    >  "xpath": "//*[@class='blog-item']/div[0]"
    
    is kind of a nightmare for anyone, and you need the devtools and JS console for that
    
    TODO something about ids
    
    >  "querySelector": "._i24ijs"
    
    Often (citation needed though) websites have completely dynamic ids, so you would need to do some sort of completely dynamic query to determine the content and the items
