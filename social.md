    I've been trying out something new this week: I'm running "Datasette Office Hours" where people can book a 20 minute Zoom call on a Friday to to talk to me about the project.
    Today was the first day for calls, and it was fantastic. I spoke to five different people and got to see some wonderful applications of the tool - from analyzing hardware test results to exploring cemetery interment records.
    If you're running an open source project and want to talk to people using your software this approach seems to work really well. I'm using Calendly for it: https://calendly.com/swillison/datasette-office-hours
