    good point that death is not a solution to our problems, and similar thought that I had that death is not a good way to appreciate life (as contrast)

    Reasons off the top of my why the majority of people don't take more action against dying.
    They think death is inevitable
    They believe in an afterlife
    Psychologically denial
    Doesn't seem relevant (for young people death may seem very far off, something that happens to other people but not them until one of their close friends die)
    They've never really sat for 5 minutes by the clock and thought about not existing

<https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cryonics>  

    The "shut up and multiply" aspect of spending $300/year (as Eliezer Yudkowsky quotes his costs for Cryonics Institute membership ($125/year) plus term life insurance ($180/year)) for a probability (how large being widely disputed) of obtaining many more years of lifespan. For this reason, cryonics advocates regard it as an extreme case of failure at rationality - a low-hanging fruit by which millions of deaths per year could be prevented at low cost.

    Alcor Foundation has two field cryoprotection kits located in England -- one with Cryonics UK and one in London. Last year, we successfully cryoprotected a young man in Bristol, despite lack of warning, and transported him to Alcor on dry ice for cool down to liquid nitrogen temperature. Contact diane@alcor.org for membership information, or read the membership section of the website.

ok, pretty good talk actually. Touches quite a few subjects, but a bit shallow. although you can't go much deeper because many things are just conjectured

eh, the guy didn't say anything particular, just something about transumanists defying human nature and wanting to get rid of emotions etc

    I agree. This was one of the most motivating articles I've read in a while. This is a man who unabashedly goes 100 % all in to whatever he wants, fully admits it's nutty, and looks like he's having the time of his life.




## `[2019-12-04]` wolfram is also thinking about digital immortality!      [[immortality]] [[lifelogging]]

    Perhaps all that data I’ve collected on myself will one day let one basically just built a “bot of me”.
    In the end all we want is freedom. I suspect that productivity optimization is our unconscious search of a (social) way of getting free.

    From my layman understanding, if you're ~20 years old you can basically just not fuck up super hard and wait another decade and we'll know a lot more. If you're 30, definitely start taking health seriously but maybe don't worry so much about downing 50 supplements that only have a bit of backing research. If you're 40 and above, and your goal is life extension... you might have to take a gamble.
