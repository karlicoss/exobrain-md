    This is cool as always, but in case anybody is seriously contemplating using it: this list is infamous for its complete uselessness for anybody actually trying to learn. It's mostly recommended because of 't Hooft's name, but it doesn't reflect how he actually learned physics himself, nor how anybody ever has, really.
    It's been "under construction" (i.e. completely abandoned) for two decades. Half the links are broken, and the ones that aren't tend to be whatever the top Google hit was in the 90s, not what's pedagogically best. If you're serious about learning physics, there are many much better roadmaps, like Susan Fowler's list https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics

ok, this is amazing.. def need to read everything

    Another question: Why in general relativity E=mc2?
    Math Answer: Because the group of Poincaré has no cohomology
