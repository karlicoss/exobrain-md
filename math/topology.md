## `[2019-04-24]` <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology)>

One often desires more structure on a manifold than simply the topological structure. For example, if one would like an unambiguous notion of differentiation of functions on a manifold, then it is necessary to construct an atlas whose transition functions are differentiable. Such a manifold is called differentiable. Given a differentiable manifold, one can unambiguously define the notion of tangent vectors and then directional derivatives.

### `[2019-04-24]` <https://mathcurve.com/surfaces.gb/planprojectif/planprojectif.shtml>

Here are classic models of the projective plane:  

-   The set of vectors of R<sup>3</sup> with the natural topology
-   A (real affine) plane completed by a projective line (line at infinity)
-   A sphere where the antipodal points are identified
-   A closed disk where the antipodal points of the circumference are identified




# `[2019-01-23]` (2) Gluing a Sphere - YouTube      [[topology]]

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmkreUEoGr8>  

    Often the fundamental group of the glued object can be calculated from the pieces (here two rectangles) and the glue (here a circle). The mathematical tool to do this is called the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem.

<https://topospaces.subwiki.org/wiki/Union_of_two_simply_connected_open_subsets_with_path-connected_intersection_is_simply_connected>  

    Both  and  are trivial, so we get  is an amalgamated free product of two trivial groups, hence it must be trivial.

@zariskitopology So "compact" doesn't mean "small": it means "doesn't have any fuzzy edges".

## `[2016-06-18]` compactness

-   usual axioms of real numbers: forall a, b: a + b = b + a, forall x, y. exists z. x \* z > y, so on
-   add constant eps  
    -   infinite number of axioms for each n: eps < 1/n
    -   eps > 0

for each finite subset of eps axioms there clearly is a model with \bbR  
for infinite set: no model with \bbR as domain! Nonstandard real numbers, hyperreals  




## `[2016-06-20]`  connectedness

Connected: can't be represented as a union of two disjoint open sets.  
Locally connected at x: for every open V(x), there is connected open U(x) &sub; V(x). X is locally connected if locally connected at every point.  

Local connectedness and connectedness are unrelated!  

Path connected: there is a path joining every pair of points.  
Locally path connected at x: for every open V(x), there is connected open U(x) \subseteq V(x). X is locally path connected if locally path connected at every point.  

Simply connected: path-connected and fundamental group is trivial.  
Locally simply connected: admits a base of simply connected sets. Also locally path-connected and locally connected.  




## `[2015-06-14]` Extracting topology from convergence

f<sub>n</sub> -> weak(\*) f if forall x. f<sub>n</sub>(x) -> f(x)  
How to develop intuition abut the open sets?  

f<sub>n</sub> converges weakly to f if it converges pointwise  

f<sub>n</sub> converges weakly to f:  
forall O(f). exists N. forall n > N. f<sub>n</sub> &isin; O  

What is O? finite number of points do not converge?  




# `[2016-06-18]` hausdorff spaces      [[topology]]

Hausdorff if any two points can be separated by neighborhoods (diagonal is closed in product topology).  

Space X is Hausdorff iff its apartness map  

&ne; : X x X -> S  
(x, y) -> { x &ne; y }  

is continuous  

Space is discrete if every singleton is open (or if its diagonal is open)  

Space is discrete iff its equality map  

\eq : X x X -> S  
(x, y) -> { x = y }  

is continuous
