    Complex balance oriented sports like skiing, snowboarding, inline skating, skateboarding, wakeboarding, surfing, rock climbing and mountain biking. These kind of sports require you to be completely focused on your task or else you end up on your ass. By being so laser focused, body and mind, you can cheat your way to a zen like state where it's impossible for you to think of anything but the here and now, you are fully in the moment.




# `[2020-09-07]` [How can you make subjective time go slower? | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24386120)      [[mind]]

    Just do new things. Go to new places, talk to new people, try new things. It can be as simple as not taking the same route to work/grocery store/etc every time. Mix it up.
    Some claim that time feels quicker as you get older because each passing minute is a smaller and smaller portion of your life(e.g. summer for a 6 year old is 5% of their life, whereas it is only half a percent of the life of a 50 year old). But I don't buy that.
    Time goes quicker as you get older because people get stuck in the same routine, and it is quite easy to compress memories together when you do the same thing every day. So, go explore, every day, even if it is just mental exploration through books or music, and time will surely slow down.

# `[2019-01-11]` [Therapy and rationality](https://reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9tckh1/therapy_and_rationality/) /r/slatestarcodex      [[therapy]]

    I hope this is relevant here since the blog itself is at the intersection of these two subjects. I'm aware there was a long thread about therapy recently, but this is a more specific question.
    I've tried a few different therapists now in the attempt to find one who's right for me, and at least two have independently told me the same thing: that my mode of discussion in the therapy sessions is too "abstract". This tends to happen when I start talking about percentage probabilities, or how well a theory fits the available facts, or whether a causal chain has a weak link ‚Äì in other words, what they call "abstract", I would call scientific or rationalist.
    When I use language like this, I'm usually trying to clarify and evaluate some assertion they've made about how my unconscious works, or what is happening in my life, or whatever. ("You think you want X, but maybe really you want Y, and that's why you do Z" etc.) And I feel like, in some cases, when their hypothesis is analysed more rigorously, it's revealed as a bit strained or patchy ‚Äì as in so many fields, a vague formulation makes a half-baked claim sound at least initially plausible.
    I'm not trying to claim I'm "too intelligent for therapy"! (These therapists have stunned me with their insights sometimes.) Only that a rationalist approach sometimes helps cut through some of the fog ‚Äì and yet therapists don't seem to welcome it much.
    Is there a real conflict here? Is therapy ‚Äì at least as it's conventionally practised in the English-speaking world ‚Äì inherently wary of an empiricist mindset? Or do I just need to keep looking for a therapist who thinks the way I do? I assume that when Scott Alexander is seeing patients, he is open to this stuff!

    No, when it comes to dating, society frowns upon thinking too much about it, instead opting for things like relying on fate, going with your gut, and hoping for the best. If a business owner took society‚Äôs dating advice for her business, she‚Äôd probably fail, and if she succeeded, it would be partially due to good luck‚Äîand that‚Äôs how society wants us to approach dating.

    I was discussing a problem with my good friend and he said something very interesting to me: "You are intelligent enough to provide an internally consistent rational framework to justify pretty much any belief you might have. But you don't have that belief because it is the rational thing to believe; people don't work like that. You started with your emotions and rationalized them to yourself. So I'm not even going to discuss that rationalization with you. I will give you advice about how to react to your emotions and I think you'll end up happier if you listen."

    I have a friend who‚Äôs an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don‚Äôt agree with very well. He‚Äôll hold up a flower and say ‚Äúlook how beautiful it is,‚Äù and I‚Äôll agree. Then he says ‚ÄúI as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,‚Äù and I think that he‚Äôs kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe‚Ä¶
    
    I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it‚Äôs not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there‚Äôs also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don‚Äôt understand how it subtracts.

very similar to my perception!
