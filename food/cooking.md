# use walnut oil for salads, not hot cooking




# stir frying

-   samphire &#x2013; useless stuff. do not buy it anymore
-   do not stir fry large things, e.g. leafy things like spinach; mushrooms unless in <span class="underline">very</span> small amounts
-   unfreeze and dry before stir frying (e.g. raw prawns)
-   heat pan properly
-   there is no such thing as too large stir fry pan
-   cut stuff in really small chunks. probably no such thing as too small; you could just stop frying
-   transfer fried things, dry with paper towel and use oil again

# flat pan vs skillet

    I have both in cast iron, I prefer the flat one for making steaks etc. as it gets a better seared crust. I use the grill pan to roast chickens and small cuts of meat, The grill ridges give it a nice lift and higher sides help with heat retention

# `[2018-08-21]` Low Carb Ramen! : ketorecipes

<https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/93hpow/low_carb_ramen/>   

    Recipe and Ingredients:
    • 100 g shirataki noodles • 100 g steak of choice • 1.5 cups beef broth • Soy sauce • Egg • Cilantro • Leeks
    “First thing you’ll need to do is cook your meat, whichever way you like. Personally, I like to fry up the steak until about an internal temperature of 140 F, set it aside to cool, then thinly slice it. I totally recommend under cooking it a tiny bit, as when you set it aside it will still be cooking internally. Next I pour out some beef broth into a small pot and let it simmer, adding in some soy sauce and lime juice. Personally I add extra salt. Like very extra.
    Now for the noodles. I have discussed shirataki noodles in a previous post – from the preparation, to the nutrition facts. I will repeat – they contain almost no calories and no carbs! Now what I do is just drain them from their package and wash through intensely with cold water. I then just add them to a bowl.
    Top the noodles with your beef broth and get to decorating. Add in your meat, the egg, and top it off with chopped cilantro and leeks. And a slice of lime of course! It makes all the difference trust me.” (Taken from blog post)

    The most important aspect of a cooking oil is its resistance to destabilization from heat. Coconut oil has the highest stability of all tested oils due to its high saturated fat content.
    Processed seed oils are so fragile they cannot even be exposed to sunlight without going rancid.

    The Best Ways to Eat Parsnips. Parsnips are typically eaten cooked. They can be eaten raw — it's just not as common




# `[2017-06-24]` different oils have different [smoke points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_point#Temperature)

-   extra virgin olive oil should  be used for low heat/salads
-   grapeseed/avocado/macadamia for high-temperature cooking.  
    macadamia is great in salads too though!

It might impact taste, i.e. there is no point burning a fancy olive oil.  
However, there aren't any proofs for the health risks
