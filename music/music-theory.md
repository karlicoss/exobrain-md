# `[2019-02-14]` How difficult is it to be able to recognize intervals? (Relative Pitch) : Guitar

<https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/2w7q5z/how_difficult_is_it_to_be_able_to_recognize/coobwgi/>  

    Yep. The easiest way I've found is to associate intervals with songs. For example, for me, a perfect 4th is the first 2 notes to "Here Comes the Bride" and a perfect 5th is the first 2 notes of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."

## `[2021-01-09]` instead use toread tags? also need to exclude from Logseq's reach maybe or make togglable?

basically would be nice to 'delete' the node on ad-hoc basis to untangle the graph  
also need some way to prevent tag inheritance for certain entries? e.g. via a property or something&#x2026;

## basic structure: drums + bass + chords + melody      [[drill]]

-   techno/trance: 160-180 bpm
-   backbean: beat every fourth, clap every eights
-   Each type of scale has a distinct sound, and many people have particular emotional associations with particular scales.
-   <https://learningmusic.ableton.com/make-melodies/ride.html>

This is an example of minimal techno; here the focus is on slow, subtle changes, primarily to the nature of the sounds themselves, rather than to the notes and rhythms.  




## harmonizing       [[study]]

    But combining (or harmonizing) the melody with some chords helps to fill out the texture. This is an example of a simple chord progression: a series of chords played in a particular order. In many types of music, chord progressions are used to create a sense of tension and release, by moving away from the tonic of the song and then back again.
    
      1-5-6-4: the most common chord progression
    
      A pre-chorus is a section that serves as a kind of link between a song’s verses and its choruses. In this song, each pre-chorus helps to build a sense of tension and energy that leads into the chorus. Each of the three eight-bar pre-choruses in this song has identical lyrics.

all powers of sqrt 2 are withing 1% error to sufficiently small rational numbers  




## would be interesting to try other roots





### `[2019-01-24]` right, as I found out later, some people did try!

why do we love harmonies and chords

    5:12 'And that's okay. It's okay to be wrong'.
    I did actually think it was an improvement but that still cracked me up.

yeah, dunno, I didn't get very convinced by his arguments
