    I greatly enjoyed Borges' work. I also like Georges Perec, especially Life: A User's Manual
    Gene Wolfe: Peace is maybe his best book IMO if you are hesitant to read something as long as the Solar Cycle

-   The entire block is primarily presented frozen in time, on June 23, 1975, just before 8 pm, moments after the death of Bartlebooth. Nonetheless, the constraints system creates hundreds of separate stories concerning the inhabitants of the block, past and present, and the other people in their lives. The story of Bartlebooth is the principal thread, but it interlinks with many others.

    Among technical books, books by Cornelius Lanczos are some of the best (less popular) books I've read. Some quotes from his "The Variational Principles of Mechanics":
    From the Preface:
    Many of the scientific treatises of today are formulated in a half-mystical language, as though to impress the reader with the uncomfortable feeling that he is in the permanent presence of a superman. The present book is conceived in a humble spirit and is written for humble people.
    From Chapter 8:
    Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. -- EXODUS III, 5

## Fredkin, Digital Philosophy

-   Why is it true that mathematics is so good at modeling processes in the physical sciences?
-   Everything fundamental is assumed to be atomic or discrete; and thereby so is everything else.
-   The principle of simplicity has driven us to reluctantly make a decision‚Äîin this paper DP is a particle model and all processes in DP are consequences of the motions and interactions of particles.

    How sci-fi should be done in 2019. You may not agree with the moral thrusts (I don't, at times), but the work is undeniably imaginative; an enchanted dream, refreshing in the age of shattered illusions. And don't miss the maze of secondary material! https://t.co/rFfrVF6Fgs

## `[2019-10-19]` Different Worlds | Slate Star Codex

<https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/02/different-worlds/>  

    People curious to know more about these kinds of things should be aware that there‚Äôs a large literature on these topics. A sort-of-okay-ish book on related topics is Handbook of Individual Differences in Social Behavior. It covers a wide variety of ways in which different people behave differently or interpret behaviour differently. One of the main things I learned from that book is that there are a lot of ways in which people are different (many more than I‚Äôd have thought), and everybody will likely have a lot of ‚Äòblind spots‚Äô in terms of these things because there are just so many ways in which people vary that it‚Äôs very difficult to spot all of them and keep them in mind, even if you know about their existence.

## `[2019-06-15]` [Anyone else loves Greg Egan? What do you think is his best work?](https://reddit.com/r/rational/comments/84m24a/anyone_else_loves_greg_egan_what_do_you_think_is/dvqkkdy/) /r/rational

    His best books for me are _Schild's Ladder_ and _Diaspora_. The first chapter of _Diaspora_ was originally published as a short story and is available online as ["Orphanogenesis"](http://www.gregegan.net/DIASPORA/01/Orphanogenesis.html).
    I would be careful about _Distress_, the first chapter was really disturbing and it doesn't lighten up all that much. It's really good, just, pushes boundaries about personhood and bodily integrity. And of course has an underpinning of weird physics, like always...
    _Quarantine_ - there's like three or four stories in this one, all entangled together. The primary arc really plays wicked games with the Copenhagen Interpretation, taking it way literally.
    ["Riding the Crocodile"](http://www.gregegan.net/INCANDESCENCE/00/Crocodile.html) and _Incandescence_ take us to a galaxy that's as far beyond the world of _Schild's Ladder_ as they are beyond us, but where people are still people no matter how much of what defines us has become optional.
    ["Dust"](https://archive.org/stream/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07_djvu.txt) and _Permutation City_ combine strange physics and strange computational neurology in odd ways. A large part of the story involves an experiment that Egan later decided was horribly unethical, and he returns to it with a whole different viewpoint in ["Crystal Nights"](http://ttapress.com/553/crystal-nights-by-greg-egan/).

    @arula_artwork @robinhouston "Dichronauts" is just the geometry of special relativity applied to 3 dimensions that the protagonists see as space. Everything about that is explained in a few short web pages. "Orthogonal" took 80K words of supplementary material to explain fully ... so that's how they compare.

## This is one reason I was glad to come across Reframing Superintelligence: Comprehensive AI Services As General Intelligence by Eric Drexler, a researcher who works alongside Bostrom at Oxford‚Äôs Future of Humanity Institute. This 200 page report is not quite as readable as Superintelligence; its highly-structured outline form belies the fact that all of its claims start sounding the same after a while. But it‚Äôs five years more recent, and presents a very different vision of how future AI might look.

    The Network Revolution ‚Äì confessions of a computer scientist (1982)¬π is the title which immediately springs to mind. I never see anyone else mention this book, but I liked it. One of the many interesting things it contains is an anonymized telling of what happened with Doug Engelbart and why, even after giving the dazzling ‚ÄúThe Mother of All Demos‚Äù¬≤, the SRI company did not succeed in its grand plan for the future of computing.
    
    It also talks a lot about very early Internet history, and gives the history of many things which I have not seen others reference, like Lee Felsenstein and Community Memory.

    Just finished "The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories" be Ken Liu and it was marvelous. The stories each pulled me in, some brought me close to tears, while others left me pensive. It was just a great experience.
    Previously I have enjoyed "Stories of Your Life and Others" and well as the new "Exhalation: Stories" both by Ted Chiang. Thought those were both great as well, and at this point I've come to appreciate short stories much more than I used to, so I was wondering if there is more like this out there, or if there is any short story collection that is dear to your heart that you could share with me?

    The relevant book for this is Measuring and Managing Information Risk: A FAIR Approach by Freund and Jones[0].
    
    Both books are worth reading; Hubbard's influence on FAIR is noticeable and positive. FAIR has the advantage that it comes with a fairly built-out ontology for assembling data or estimates. The OP touches on the top level (Loss Event Magnitude and Loss Event Frequency), but the ontology goes quite deep and can be used at multiple levels of detail.

    Ted Nelson published Computer Lib / Dream Machines in 1974. I read it that year. It‚Äôs the incredible vision that specifically inspired the web‚Äîand it was about *books*.
    Half a century later, Andy & I are approximately the only people in the world who write hypertext books.

    How to manage information overload? What are the real bottlenecks? How can we make vastly better computer note taking systems? Why haven't we gone beyond the file metaphor? How can we build better personal memory systems? Better collective memory systems? So many great problems!

    By contrast, fish do not have any neural architecture unique to the consciousness-related parts of the brain and are probably unable to feel fear or pain in the way a human would ‚Äì we strongly encourage you to read this article in full to convince yourself of this claim. Although fish show pain-like responses to harmful stimulus and do so less if given painkillers, this is true even when the entire telencephalon (which includes the forebrain) is removed so on balance it is unlikely they are having a qualitative experience to accompany that response.

    Lectures on Quantum Mechanics (1966): Much of this book deals with quantum mechanics in curved space-time.
    Lectures on Quantum Field Theory (1966): This book lays down the foundations of quantum field theory using the Hamiltonian formalism.
    Spinors in Hilbert Space (1974): This book based on lectures given in 1969 at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, USA, deals with the basic aspects of spinors starting with a real Hilbert space formalism. Dirac concludes with the prophetic words "We have boson variables appearing automatically in a theory that starts with only fermion variables, provided the number of fermion variables is infinite. There must be such boson variables connected with electrons..."
    General Theory of Relativity (1975): This 69-page work summarises Einstein's general theory of relativity.
