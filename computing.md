    A "Schlep" is a thing that is so tedious or awful to deal with, that most people accept it or work around it without even realizing it. However, when attacked directly, they can open new doors or make things easier by opening paths that are otherwise accepted as just "the way things are".

    What do I mean by “better”?
    Computing aids and encourages humanity’s noblest pursuits: science, reason, art, philosophy.
    Computing directly supports improving the mental health, physical health, prosperity, and happiness of all humans.
    Computing help us master (or at least, doesn’t intensify) our problematic tendencies: addiction, status anxiety, socioeconomic divisions, tribalism, fear, hate.
    The economic and intellectual horsepower in Silicon Valley and the wider tech world seems to be pointed away from these goals.
    For example: algorithms designed to maximize watch time, the social media outrage machine, loot boxes and other psuedo-gambling, and smartphone notifications activating Skinner-box tendencies.

    What's crazy to me is how insanely overspec'd mobile devices are for what they deliver. If you went back in time and told 1999 me the following:
    I'll give you a computer with the following:
    * 256GB of solid-state storage
    * 6 CPUs @ 3+GHz
    * 8GB of RAM
    * Weighs only 200 grams
    * Battery-powered, lasts 5+ hours
    * 1440 x 3168 resolution display
    I would have been absolutely gobsmacked. Such a machine absolutely outclasses every desktop up into the early 2010s!

    Which is exactly why I prefer formal query languages over NLP queries. In both cases (at least with most state of the art NLP techniques), you have to learn certain patterns and ways to phrase a query so that the system will reliably understand it. With formal query languages, these patterns are well-defined, can be looked up and will most likely not change significantly (so there is value in memorizing them). With NLP systems, the patterns are completely opaque, you have to learn them through trial and error, they may change anytime (e.g. because the model is retrained) and they are usually significantly less powerful.
    I sometimes feel that the trend to prefer NLP over formal query languages is comparable to the trend to prefer GUIs over consoles in the 80ies and 90ies.

    Some things that work really well that are often hard in native GUI toolkits:
        You can zoom pretty much any content as large or small as you like. Doing this in native UI involves either editing obscure config files, or mucking about with the system’s DPI settings (not easy to zoom per-app or changing zoom levels depending on mood or screen you’re using).
        More cross-platform than pretty much anything else.
        Open anything in a new context (tab or window).
        Copy/paste anything.
        Search any text with e.g. Ctrl+F.
        Back button.
        Modifying anything easily; even if you’re not doing this directly yourself this has huge benefits in the form of e.g. some simple bookmarklets, or your adblocker.
        Unlike desktop applications, everything is sandboxed. If you think persistent tracking and fingerprinting on the web is bad: it’s even easier on the desktop. Something like hash(/etc/passwd) should do the trick to generate a persistent unique device ID.

# `[2020-10-08]` [Generalizing 'jq' and Traversal Systems using optics and standard monads | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24710565) intuition behind lenses

    The point is really that lenses are values that represent locations in a data structure. And, as values, they can be combined, transformed, serialized, etc etc. Imagine having a type that represents a chain of method selectors, and that gives you some idea of the purpose.
    The fact that method selectors only appear very rarely as first-class values in most languages means that most people aren’t tuned in to scenarios where they could be applied. But I bet you’ve invented special cases of this yourself, when you had a function that needed to dig data out of one of several locations, depending on other inputs.

    It definitely can feel a bit strained at times, but the basic metaphor of:

    - prisms “split” a sum type so that optics can work over selected branches
    ...feels nice when you’ve been working with it for awhile.

    In my opinion, a security model that cuts this deeply into the ecosystem and customisability deserves only criticism. I don’t want to have such a platform for my personal computing needs.
    Security is nice, but my needs on my own machine come first. A device that is secure but doesn’t do what I want is useless to me. I need root access to make my machine do what I want because that is the only purpose the machine has: To do what I and only I want. I don’t need a machine that does what someone else wants - they should buy and maintain that machine if it serves them! The von Neumann architecture contains a memory that stores data and instructions.
    I don’t want to go back into computing stone age before von Neumann just because Apple (or anyone else, for that matter) thinks only they know what’s okay to execute.
    Without these permissions, modern computing is less exciting than the computers that existed 40 years ago.

        We call this representation of knowledge or model of the world or something.
        And these wonderful, ah, high powered programs each use one way of representing the world and one way of representing knowledge.
        But in language, each thing we do uses, I suspect, three or four major different kinds of representations and maybe 20 or 30 minor ones.
        And so, everything than an ordinary person does in ordinary life is a, is, consists of maybe 20 different ways of preceding{?) and all their relations between them.
-   .

    Minsky: The computer is when people started understanding processes instead of just static things.
           ...Before 1950 there was no way to describe something that was changing.
    Minsky:  So most people don't know that what happened in 1950 that man for the first time learned to talk.
             We didn't have—everybody says well we learned speech sometime 30,000 years ago, nobody knows when.
             But what I'm saying is a thousand years from now it'll be 1950 when, when this animal learned to talk.
             The stuff before was just emotional utterances 'cause he couldn't describe processes, he could just describe...there's a thing there.

    The fundamental challenge of GUIs is that they have state as a core concern. Unlike most systems, state is not an implementation detail that can be refactored away. It is central to the problem domain. The end user sees and cares about having a stateful system.
    The hardest part of dealing with state in a complex system is maintaining consistency in different places. Some instances of this this can be avoided by creating single-sources-of-truth, but in other cases you can't unify your state, or you're dealing with an external stateful system (like the DOM), and you have no choice but to find a way to keep separate pieces of state in sync.
    I should probably write a blog post on this

    If you want to support policy action in favour of interoperability, that's what we're working on at EDRi, so donating to EDRi evidently helps :) Alternatively: if you're building software that would benefit from mandatory interoperability of dominant digital services, I'd like to hear from you. Having concrete examples for our advocacy work is hugely beneficial!

    What also frustrates me is when "dark mode" has become a major product/feature announcement. I mean... how low are we going to set the bar?

    Btw, very good point about state. Since containers (and Docker in particular) spread, it's become much easier to try out new software, I know that I can always just delete the container (or even resume setting it up later) and it will be all fine. As in, at least I don't end up with half-broken package manager dependencies, etc. Physical world doesn't quite have this property :) Although the state is much more explicit

    I really can't be arsed with this stuff any more.
    Why are the developers at Google acting in such boneheaded ways? Is it literally just "I get paid loads of money, lol"? Do people not grow out of that eventually when they have enough?
    Like, you're literally a developer. Why would you make something you wouldn't want to use? Is the company just wholly made up of people who actually don't care about computing?

    Wikipedia is even pushing further forward on that vision with Wikidata, a general-purpose knowledge base that's perhaps the most successful example of such a thing, succeeding where many other efforts have failed dismally. (Already, Wikidata gets more edits per minute than Wikipedia, albeit much of the activity is performed by bots.) It's also a successful use of Linked-Open-Data and Semantic-Web technologies (the Wikidata site hosts a SPARQL endpoint, for general queries of all sorts), so while it might not be "Old Web" per se, it feels quite retro-futuristic in many ways.

    And of course, all the well-known personal assistant AI's rely on it quite a bit, although they're not eager to advertise that fact.

    Even Firefox dropped it's built-in RSS support by now, so for the current September generation, this is meaningless, unfortunately. Still, as infrastructure, it's very important, because it's simple to transform RSS into other formats: JSON feed, h-feed[^1], etc.
    As for how to "follow" (I'd prefer to use subscribe instead) a personal site these days, it's a hard problem, reasonably well documented here: https://indieweb.org/follow
    There is a current effort, called microsub[^2] to tackle the problem, but it's new, and is not user friendly enough at all.
