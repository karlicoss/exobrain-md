# `[2017-11-30]` protein folding      [[complexity]]

given a chain of amino acids, can you predict how is it going to fold?  
ideally, folding should end up in the minimal energy state. if it doesn't you end up with prions?  
in general, folding is an NP complete problem, are our body cells actually solving them somehow?  
conjecture: evolution wouldn't actually use hard instances of protein folding, only computationally easy ones.  




# `[2017-05-15]` [Fermentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fermentation)

yeast anaerobic -> alcohol  
muscle anaerobic -> lactic acid  

    Fermentation is a metabolic process that converts sugar to acids, gases, and/or alcohol.
    Fermentation takes place in the lack of oxygen (when the electron transport chain is unusable) and becomes the cell’s primary means of ATP (energy) production.[1] It turns NADHand pyruvate produced in the glycolysis step into NAD+ and various small molecules depending on the type of fermentation (see examples below). In the presence of O2, NADH and pyruvate are used to generate ATP in respiration. This is called oxidative phosphorylation, and it generates much more ATP than glycolysis alone. For that reason, cells generally benefit from avoiding fermentation when oxygen is available. Exceptions include obligate anaerobes, which cannot tolerate oxygen.

    Пируваты (соли пировиноградной кислоты) — важные химические соединения в биохимии. Они являются конечным продуктом метаболизма глюкозы в процессегликолиза. Одна молекула глюкозы превращается при этом в две молекулы пировиноградной кислоты. Дальнейший метаболизм пировиноградной кислоты возможен двумя путями — аэробным и анаэробным.

    The issue with these animations is that they're getting rid of all the thermal noise.
    In reality, single proteins are flying around the whole length of the cell many times a second, just from their thermal motion.
    And when processes like DNA transcription happen, they're not like a regular conveyor belt -- a fraction of the time the machine will even accidentally run steps in reverse!
    However, if any of this were shown, the animations would become impossible to understand.




## `[2020-05-09]` <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22993812>

    It's not so much "magic" as it is the sheer rate of molecular collisions in the cytosol. There are so many collisions happening that at least one of them will do what you want. Here's a back-of-the-napkin example, admittedly with many simplifications:
    A tRNA molecule at body temperature travels at roughly 10 m/s. Assuming a point-sized tRNA and stationary ribosome of radius 125 * 10^-10 m, the ray casted by the moving tRNA will collide with the ribosome when their centers are within 125 * 10^-10 m of each other. The path of the tRNA sweeps a "collidable" circle of the radius of 125 * 10^-10 m, for a cross-sectional area of 5 * 10^-16 m^2. Multiplied by the tRNA velocity, the tRNA sweeps a volume of 5 * 10^-15 m^3 per second. Constrained inside an ordinary animal cell of volume 10^-15 m^3, the tRNA would have swept the entire volume of the cell five times over in a single second. Obviously the collision path would have significant self-overlap, but at this rate it's quite likely for the two to collide at least once any given second.
    Now, consider that this analysis was only for a single ribosome/tRNA pair. A single ribosome will experience this collision rate multiplied by the total number of tRNA in the cell, on the order of thousands to millions. If a ribosome is bombarded by tens of thousands of tRNA in a single second, it's very likely one of those tRNA will (1) be charged with an amino acid, (2) be the correct tRNA for the current 3-nucleotide sequence, and (3) collide specifically with the binding site on the ribosome in the correct orientation. In actuality, a ribosome synthesizes a protein at a rate of ~10 amino acid residues per second.
    Any given molecule in the cell will experience millions to billions of collisions per second. The fact that molecules move so fast relative to their size is what allows these reactions to happen on reasonable timescales.

    My question was inspired by learning that [lutein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutein#/media/File:Lutein_molecule_spacefill.png) and [zeaxanthin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeaxanthin#/media/File:Zeaxanthin_molecule_spacefill.png) are nearly identical molecules (C40H56O2), with the only difference between the two being that a single double bond is found in neighboring positions along a hexagon at one end of the molecule. These molecules are rather large. How are molecular structures determined so exactly? When did chemists acquire this capability? And what were the major milestones in our ability to determine molecular structure?

    I don't just mean how many of each kind of element and where they are, but also things as subtle as the position of a single double bond. A lot of molecules are smaller than a wavelength of visible light, so it's not as if we could just look at them under a microscope, yet we know their structures exactly. So how do chemists figure these things out?




# `[2020-04-05]` [How does “even if this flu shot isn’t an exact match, if you do get the flu it won’t be as bad” work?](https://reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fvcjhn/how_does_even_if_this_flu_shot_isnt_an_exact/fmi7dix/) /r/askscience      [[vaccine]]

    There's actually a very cool effect where either getting infected with flu or getting vaccinated boosts your antibody response to all previous strains of flu you've encountered (by getting flu or by being vaccinated). In recent years WHO have begun to shift towards using antigenically advanced vaccines, whereby they predict how currently circulating strains of flu will evolve and artificially create vaccines for the flu strain they think will be circulating in 6 months time, as even if the virus doesn't mutate to a new strain, the antibody backboost means you still get protection against most circulating strains. Check out this paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4246172/) if you want a more detailed explanation, but basically the vaccine can boost your antibody response to a fairly wide range of influenza virus strains  (this is at least true for type A H3N2 influenza, there are 4 different types of influenza in the annual vaccine)
