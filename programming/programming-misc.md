# Variance       [[plt]]

    The question: what are the conditions for the function A -> B to be a subtype of C -> D?
    
    1. A is subtype of B means there is a special function castAB :: A -> B
    2. Two casts compose into another casts, cast compositions are isomorphic (that is, castBC . castAB is essentially the same thing as castAC)
    3. We wanna implement castAfB -> castCfD in order to show (A -> B) <: (C -> D)
    
      - X :: (A -> B) -> (C -> D)
      - we can only use functions applications and cast
      - X (fab :: A -> B) (c :: C) = ? :: D
      - the only thing we can do is to transform c to some another type, that is, we need castCT :: C -> T
      - now, we have (castCT c) :: T, basically, leaves us in the same situation, so, we actually need castCA :: C -> A
      - now, we have (castCA c) :: A, and (fab $ castCA c) :: B. The only way to get D is to use castBD :: B -> D
    
    5. So, we have (A -> B) <: (C -> D), that is, A -> B is subtype of C -> D if C is subtype of A and B is subtype of D.
    
    
    The return type (B and D) is covariant, since preserves the direction of <:
    The argument type (A and C) is contravariant, since it flips the direction of <:
    
    
    Container reading: covariant:
    
    : S <: T, then ReadonlyCollection<S> <: ReadonlyCollection<T>
    
    Container writing: contravariant:
    
    : S <: T, then Consumer<T> <: Consumer<S>
    
    - C++ poiners: covariant
    - Java
      - arrays: covariant
      - Collection<? extends T>: covariant
      - Collection<? super T>: contravariant

Get the python viewers from SVN  
svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk/libstdc++-v3/python  

    Add the following to your ~/.gdbinit
    python
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/pretty-printers/dir')
    from libstdcxx.v6.printers import register_libstdcxx_printers
    register_libstdcxx_printers (None)
    end

You have to make sure that you have the package with the libstdc++ library compiled with the debugging flags.  

For clang: `-fno-limit-debug-info` do not limit debug information produced to reduce size of debug binary

    The cookie law is not actually about cookies (and its not actually called the cookie law). Its about tracking users, storing and sharing the information with third parties. Cookies are just the most popular method to track users.
    If you don't want to show the "cookie warning" then just don't track the users beyond the session and don't share traffic data with third parties.

    This project is a collection of static corpora (plural of "corpus") that are potentially useful in the creation of weird internet stuff.

So for the last year I've been copy/pasting an adjs.json file from project to project. This is kind of awful, so I'm hoping that this project will at least help me keep everything in one place.




# Nullable strings Vs unset column in databade      [[db]]

    Most of this advice is stuff they tell you in school that doesn‚Äôt matter at all in reality.
    Real advice:
    - Normalize until it hurts, denormalize until it works. (I.e. prefer normal forms but denormal will have better performance.)
    - You need nullable dates and nullable numbers. You never need a nullable string. If you must distinguish blank string from unset, add a column called ‚Äúunset‚Äù. Using null for this will just result in bad data entry.
    - Names should be stored as display_name, first_name, and last_name. A display name is not the same as just first plus last. They have different purposes, so don‚Äôt shove them together.
    - When in doubt, just have a column full of JSON and figure it out later.
    - Offset pagination is bad for performance. Avoid it at all costs unless you want some spider indexing page 10,432 of your archives to eat all your CPU.

    I've always liked this example, from _Practical Common Lisp_ (2007).
    > `DOLIST` is similar to Perl's `foreach` or Python's `for`. Java added a similar kind of loop construct with the "enhanced" `for` loop in Java 1.5, as part of JSR-201. Notice what a difference macros make. A Lisp programmer who notices a common pattern in their code can write a macro to give themselves a source-level abstraction of that pattern. A Java programmer who notices the same pattern has to convince Sun that this particular abstraction is worth adding to the language. Then Sun has to publish a JSR and convene an industry-wide "expert group" to hash everything out. That process--according to Sun--takes an average of 18 months. After that, the compiler writers all have to go upgrade their compilers to support the new feature. And even once the Java programmer's favorite compiler supports the new version of Java, they probably still can't use the new feature until they're allowed to break source compatibility with older versions of Java. So an annoyance that Common Lisp programmers can resolve for themselves within five minutes plagues Java programmers for years.

    We don't need new languages without features: it has already been proven that you only need exactly one feature in your programming language to write any program possible. Look up single instruction languages for proof that it is possible and such single features languages exist.
    What we need are languages with many features that are easy to use to create complex programs that are still easy to understand.

    awk
    This was a tool written by three of the smartest people in the field at the time (Aho, Weinberger, Kernighan) to solve a problem they had often.
    awk is still an excellent tool for exploring unstructured, semi-structured, and record-based data, and can be abused for lots of other use cases. Despite it‚Äôs age, it still includes many features that people expect from modern languages (hash tables, not having to pre-declare variables, easy use of regexes). If you know awk, you can throw out a lot of other shell tools, such as grep, cut, head, tail, and many more. Where I might have reached for a dozen or two line Python script, I often just write a dozen or two characters of awk.
    ‚ÄúThe AWK Programming Language‚Äù is one of the clearest and most concise technical books I‚Äôve ever read, and definitely the best ROI I‚Äôve gotten from reading any book.

    The fundamental difference between Rust's approach and Java-style checked exceptions arises when those three functions have different error types. In Java, you would annotate the function with every possible exception that the function can throw. In Rust, a library (or module with a library) would normally design its own Result type to encompass every error that the library/module can throw, and use that type on every error-producing function (you could reproduce the Java approach by defining a new Result type for each function, but I've never seen anyone bother with that).

    Not an Athens developer, but hopefully can give some general advice..
    Generally open source projects welcome contributions, especially if the contribution complies with project guidelines, covered with tests, doesn't contain unrelated changes, etc.. However there are some things to consider:
    
    One of the biggest factors is maintainer's time, and often guiding a person to improve their code takes more time & energy than implementing the same from scratch.
    I guess for this the only advice is to read guides carefully, search stuff & ask elsewhere if possible, so you would ideally only ask the maintainers for things specific for the project.
    Basically whatever you would do in general when you're doing independent learning. Although of course the author might be happy to guide you for small things -- which is great too. But good to keep this in mind.
    
    Another factor to keep in mind is that the developers might want to keep the project compact and minimal in terms of features.
    The reason is that generally the more features you have, the more code you have ===> the more likely it would break which is a burden on the maintainer.
    Plus depending on the project features that maintainer isn't using themselves would end up poorly tested (yet another reason to make sure you have tests with your contribution if possible).
    To avoid this it's best to ask the maintainers whether the feature would be welcome in advance. It's very sad to work on something for a week to find out they don't want to merge it. In some cases you can work off a fork, but not always.
    
    Apart from this, I can't imagine the cases when bugfixes or extra test coverage won't be welcome. Which could also be a great way to get familiar with a new project (or even programming language!).

# `[2016-10-30]` Java: good and bad      [[java]]





## good 

-   JVM  
    -   interop with other JVM languages
    -   portable
-   well defined standard:  
    -   safe semantics
    -   concurrency
-   community
-   libraries




## Bad 

-   super call goes first  
    -   use static method which takes the parameters? Problem with two arguments, although we could make a private constructor for that&#x2026;
-   no real notion of immutability
-   no nullable types
-   no generics declaration site variance (producers/consumers)  
    -   example: immutable Stream<T>, method which returns Stream<R>. If we override it as List in java, there is no way to return List<R>
-   no sum tupes/closed classes (enums are the closest alternative but have no states)  
    -   if we make interface private, it is hidden from outside
    -   alternative: factory methods, enum methods take 'state' as argument
-   no type synonims
-   no 'const' keyword




## ? 

-   lack of operators overloading (but sometimes it makes sense)
-   GC: both good and bad

    Pull request events for forked repositories
    Note: Workflows do not run on private base repositories when you open a pull request from a forked repository.
    When you create a pull request from a forked repository to the base repository, GitHub sends the pull_request event to the base repository and no pull request events occur on the forked repository.
    Workflows don't run on forked repositories by default. You must enable GitHub Actions in the Actions tab of the forked repository.
