How to make good programming (specially open source) projects?  

I don't claim to be an expert, but I think I have accumulated a fair amound of experience.  

Here I collect best practices, or at least the ones I liked.

    Design Goals

it's good to state design goals  




# \* compare with similar projects

Often there are multiple projects that do the same thing, and it's nice to know why you should prefer one over another.

    very cool comparison page, I really like it




# \* demos      [[demo]]

-   it's nice if you can provide a web-based demo that doesn't require any installation.
-   perhaps the next worst thing is something like a Docker container &#x2013; you can safely try it knowing you won't mess up your OS  
    It also basically means 'reproducible build', and easer testing.

    Wow, the project homepage has a great dynamic command-line generator that lets you specify what you are trying to do.
    This may exist elsewhere, but it's the first time I've seen it and I hope to see it on more projects! https://www.visidata.org/

    As others said, I recommend adding a GitHub pages of a demo or something. Not fun having to spin this up yourself to test what it does/looks like.

## `[2021-02-13]` [Database Configuration | InfluxData Documentation Archive](https://archive.docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.2/administration/config/#enabled-false)      [[configs]]

    [admin]
    Controls the availability of the built-in, web-based admin interface.
        Note: The Admin UI is deprecated as of InfluxDB 1.2.
    enabled = false
    Set to true to enable the admin interface.
    
    Environment variable: INFLUXDB_ADMIN_ENABLED

I guess it's a good pattern?  
e.g. split env variable by \_ and bind to code  




## `[2021-01-09]` [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html#keyboard-shortcuts)      [[ui]]

good setting design with system defaults (readonly) and user preferences on the side

Documentation is frustrating because it usually requires you to document what you already know, it's usually also duplicates tests, docstrings etc.

# \* screencasting      [[screencast]]

I found screencasting to be pretty finicky.  
Especially when you want to automate things, e.g. like I did with short demos for [promnesia](https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#readme).  
(see [demos.py](https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/blob/65e77cd67740ef391cba73bc9eac200d9a5b6e63/tests/demos.py) &#x2013; it's extremely hacky and not sure how to make it generic)

    That looks really cool.  Note that many users don't know what CFEngine is, so you might want to mention that (then again, maybe users who don't already know what it is don't matter, haha).
    Your demo GIF is pretty cool.  You might find this interesting: after recording and tidying up demo GIFs for `helm-org-ql` several times, I wrote a shell script to make it easier.  Using the `gif-screencast` package for Emacs, all I have to do is run the script, make the Emacs window active, and it does the rest.

    I'm happy to announce the release gif-screencast 1.1!
    https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/emacs-gif-screencast
    
    It isn't much, but I know that gif-screencast has had annoying issues for a
    while, I figured I'd rather let the community know!
    
    - Fix off-by-one error in frame delay (thanks to /u/alphapapa for this one!)
    - Remove "Press ... to stop" message from resulting GIF.
    - New `gif-screencast-start-or-stop` command.
    - Log the complete command lines of all invokes commands.

## `[2020-04-02]` [phw/peek: Simple animated GIF screen recorder with an easy to use interface](https://github.com/phw/peek#how-can-i-capture-mouse-clicks-andor-keystrokes)

    Peek does not support this natively. But you could install an external tool like key-mon which is usually included in most distributions, so you can easily install with your package manager. Then start key-mon with key-mon --visible_click. The --visible_click option is for drawing small circles around mouse clicks.

-   `[2020-04-02]` looked at peek for demo automation, and it doesn't quite do the trick  
    -   you can continue/pause recording from the console
    -   you can't set window id/adjust (granted, you can do it externally via xdotool which is arguably more modular)
    -   you can't set recording format/path from the console (and even save the video?)  
        that made it useless for my purposes

## `[2020-04-02]` recordmyscreen

I think it dumps broken ogv file. There is some jerkiness.  
When you convert it to something else with ffmpeg, it's complaining about broken frames and sometimes even segfaults  

also it hasn't been updated for a decade, apparently  




# \* landing page

Often "langing pages" for startups are bloated and very infromation sparse.  
For open source projects it's usually better though (especially considering readme is usually enough!).  
Here I'll collect the ones I liked.

    GPL (any version)
    Bad: doesn‚Äôt have the ‚Äúnetwork protection‚Äù: you don‚Äôt need to submit changes back to me if you modify the code and run it only as a SaaS.




## `[2019-10-12]` [Licenses ‚Äì opensource.google.com](https://opensource.google/docs/thirdparty/licenses/#restricted)

    GNU GPL v1, v2, v3




## `[2019-10-12]` [Licenses ‚Äì opensource.google.com](https://opensource.google/docs/thirdparty/licenses/#LinkingRequirements)

    The following steps are required in order to be able to take advantage of the reduced requirements:
        The LGPL-licensed library must be used as a shared library (dynamically-linked).
        For LGPL v3 only, the user must be able to replace the shared library with a compatible library and have it work (the user must be able to swap out libraries on the device).
        Customers must receive either object files or source code (including any modifications) of the LGPL-licensed library.

## `[2019-12-11]` [Create LICENSE by MitchTalmadge ¬∑ Pull Request #10 ¬∑ kootenpv/gittyleaks](https://github.com/kootenpv/gittyleaks/pull/10)

    If you are the copyright holder, it's up to you how you license your work ‚ÄîI think the only catch is that you can't retrospectively revoke open-source licenses for previous versions, but I think you could easily publish an updated version with a different license, or even license with two different licenses if you wanted to. Also, if others have previously contributed to the project whilst it was under a given license, you will need their permission to relicense it, unless you have a copyright-grant agreement with them (such that they assign copyright to their contributions to you).




# \* naming

It's annoying to have to come up with name when the project is ready and you are keen to release it.  

-   my personal strategy is thinking and having short brainstoming sessions now and then and writing down ideas  
    Then after some time I just pick the one I like most.
-   use thesaurus to find synonyms
-   make sure it's unique enough, search for existing projects with the same name

# \* versioning





## `[2020-01-02]` for end user software (i.e. not 'libraries'), calendar versioning is more useful than semantic




## ok, definitely should keep changelog in the repository file (and then link to headings), instead of github native interface

The reason is to avoid siloing the changelog on Github. It's fine to also copy it on "Releases" page as well, but make the CHANGELOG.md (or any other plaintext file) the primary source of truth.
