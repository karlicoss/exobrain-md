Ok, let's figure out why there is so much hype about lisp.

    The second thing is, intermediate variables makes code much more readable, but lisp strongly discourages this. The only way to create a lexical variable is with LET. But this causes indenting, which is pretty ugly. In fact, the use of indenting for both logical nesting and variable creation is a really nasty thing:

    Okay, so when Clojure came along, it came with a strong underlying philosophy of what the language was supposed to be/do. Among them were design decisions such as, e.g.,:
    
      - VMs, not OSes, are the platforms of the future, so target the JVM
      - Object Orientation is overrated, but polymorphism is a good thing
      - Multi-core is here to stay, so use immutable data structures to greatly facilitate writing correct concurrent programs
      - Leverage the strengths of LISP but give it a modern overhaul (most notably, throw in different parenthesis)

    Syntax is of course the most obvious `backward' thing. Conceptually Lisp moves you away from the machine and closer to math, Forth stays way closer. Forth does not (normally) include a garbage collector. Naming variables is discouraged. Forth is almost untyped, Lisp is strongly-dynamically typed.

    Honest question:
    What's so great about Lisp?




# `[2018-10-03]` Scheme Lisp: feel the cool Andy Balaam Accu 2018      [[lisp]]

-   38:46 weird code as data (define s (lsit '+ 4 7))
-   `[2019-10-20]` eh, very basic talk and also doesn't really communicate why scheme/lisp are cool if you're experienced with multiple languages already. Thing with numbers and mscons at the end can be done on any PL




# Write a post following that common lisp post and comparing      [[python]] [[lisp]]

I don't mean to offend lisp lovers or anything. I'm just desperately trying to find what's so special about lisp I don't see, so would be happy to know if you Todo missing aspect

        if 'failed to find libmagic' in emsg: # probably the actual library is missing?...
