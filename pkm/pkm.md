    Yeah, maybe I'm not a typical person - but I collect, parse & use a lot of data, so I really need my stuff well organized.

    I think Org transcends the idea of a wiki.  What is a wiki, anyway?  Documents with links to themselves.  Org does that and much more.
    For myself, I keep information in several Org files.

    * Information that doesn't change much, that I need to refer to now and then, that fits in a hierarchy, goes in `reference.org`.
    * Things I come across randomly that I want to record for later (e.g. web pages, snippets, quotes) goes in `cpb.org` (for commonplace book) in a datetree; I can find it later with Org search tools, including `helm-org-rifle`.
    * Appointments that are independent of other entries go in `calendar.org`.
    * Stuff I need to refile goes in `inbox.org`, but I'm trying to get in the habit of putting things in `cpb.org` instead of putting them in a massive inbox file, thinking that I'll refile them later; I never do, so I might as well put them in a datetree, which at least organizes them chronologically rather than a giant, flat list.
      * This includes archived web pages, which I now capture with `org-web-tools-attach-url-archive`.  Sometimes I also capture the plain-text readable parts of web pages with `org-web-tools-read-url-as-org` or directly into a capture template with `org-web-tools--url-as-readable-org`.
    * Most project and task stuff goes in `main.org`.
    * Personal log/journal/diary-type entries go in `log.org`.
    * Transient stuff goes in `temp.org` (which is excluded from the git repo I keep Org files in).
    * Things I'm working on right now and want to keep in front of me (sort of like a sticky note on a monitor) go in `now.org`, which I access and manage with `org-now`.

    Hope that helps!

    Remember, Org is a platform for building your own system.  Take it easy, take your time, enjoy the ride.  Emacs and Org are software for the rest of your life.

    I have been using Memex for more than a year now. Here are the things that really annoy me
    - occasional freezing and sudden disappearance of your bookmarks
    - no real way to programmatically access your Memex database. I know they have released the storage backend, but the lack of helpful documentation is a deal-breaker.
    - lack of collaborative annotation (the way Hypothesis does)
    - only few results in search results!

### dentist 

dentist appointment at 10 am. You are likely to get a filling which requires you not to eat or drink anything that might color it for 24 hours.  
 On the same day at 9pm you have a meeting with your friends at a pub. You like drinking Kriek, which definitely might color your teeth! Can we prevent such a conflict?

    Local cache would definitely be the (easiest) way of solving it. Tools like Memex [0] are most of the way there.
    But a text-only copy on my local device isn't great if the content had special formatting in presentation. Also, it misses out on images or embedded videos. That's where something like ArchiveBox [1] comes in.
    > ArchiveBox takes a list of website URLs you want to archive, and creates a local, static, browsable HTML clone of the content from those websites (it saves HTML, JS, media files, PDFs, images and more).
    But really what I'd like to see at some point is an opt-in community tool where every page I visit that fits a certain criteria (URL, topic, special mark by me, etc) is fully cloned and uploaded to IPFS [2] for anyone interested in that topic to find and use later - regardless of what happens to the source content. Definitely a host of legal issues around this, but not impossible.

    Liquid Text (@LiquidTextCorp) has a great feature allowing you to "scrunch" up pages of PDFs to quickly compare what you're reading with something earlier. (The correct way to do split screen IMO) I find myself trying to do this with web browsers now. It really is a nice feature.

# Guy who thought about pkm issues      [[pkm]]

    I have thought about these issues a lot; especially lately. With regards to being able to scrape your data or just get your data back from 3rd party's, I think that's a losing battle. You need to be in control of your data before it gets to them. Web sites and APIs are constantly changing and sometimes just disappear. This idea of polling for changes seems very brittle and would never be up to date.
    
    What I picture is an a program that you use to store your own microblogs, blogs, contacts, comments, etc. and then you publish to whoever from that app via their API or crawling.
    
    Imagine you just created a new microblog entry. You can now either post to your Twitter, Mastodon, etc. accounts with the click of a button. You would have to poll for replies though and it would be up to you to store them if you wished (you probably want to if you are storing your replies). As an added benefit you could see the replies in one place instead of bouncing between two sites.
    
    The point is, when you create the data, it's yours first. Then if you want to, you can post it other places. Tools like this are abundant for businesses, but we don't seem to build tools for actual people anymore.

then you build a graph based on the property. your notes aren't scattered across the filesystem that way

# Nototo is a spatial note-taking app. It lets you build an ever-expanding, topographical map containing your notes and writing. The app is designed this way to take advantage of another aspect of spatial interfaces: our brains remember spaces better than raw information. In this regard, Nototo is like a software manifestation of a memory palace.

# `[2019-05-19]` modifying reading stats (number of books read and hours read)? - MobileRead Forums

<https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=212875>  

    For events 1, 36, 52 and 79 there seem to be only one row.
    
    There are some inconsistencies. Both events 46 and 80 count page turns, but they don't match. The count for 80 is always less than for 46. It is possible that 46 is counting screens and 80 page numbers. The value for 46 is what is on the stats screen for the current book.
    
    When I have looked at ExtraData, it tends to be made up of a series of timestamps. I suspect that for events like 1020 and 1021, it is a list of the times when the event occurred. The pairs from the two events might be used to calculate the minutes per session and hours read. The only problem with that, is that the counts don't match for the book I am currently reading. I am confident of the meaning of the events, but there seems to be occasions when the close is not recorded.

    Hi everyone,
    I wanted to share a new knowledge management tool called [Gist](https://www.gistapp.com), for exploring data visually and adding context to digital collections.
    Full disclosure—I'm the founder. Gist is a spin-off from [Schema](https://www.schemadesign.com), a data visualization design firm based in Seattle. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the tool—whether you think it would be useful, and how you would best describe it. Since it spans so many usecases, from KM for internal teams to "memory organizations" (museums, libraries, archives) and research organizations, finding a way to describe it to all audiences has been an interesting challenge.
    I'd be curious to hear your thoughts. Thanks!

    Nice work! However it is possible to search through annotations using emacs pdf-tools, actually the search and filter functions are quite powerful in the annotation tablist, but you need to show contents first in the tablist buffer by customizing the pdf-annot-list-format variable (more info is found in issue 553: https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools/issues/553). The annotation tablist functionality is more or less only documented in its major-mode info. The code for the search function posted in that issue works nice also (actually it works better than searching via the tablist because there is a bug in the tablist search as mentioned in the comments of that issue).
    
    Additionally I read that you don't like to use the mouse to add annotations. With the code in the pdf-avy-highlight.el file in this repository: https://github.com/dalanicolai/dala-emacs-lisp it is possible to highlight text and add comments (if you set to open them automatically by toggling the Pdf Annot Activate Created Annotations to "on" in the pdf-annot group in the customization menu) with only the keyboard using avy. You should should add your own shortcut for it (the one in the file is for use in Spacemacs). Unfortunately it does not work more conveniently than using the mouse. But I just like to point out the possibilities and versatility of emacs and pdf-tools...

    Empirically untrue, sadly. From reminiscing with friends, it's clear that both they and I have forgotten some of the best times, since I remember some of the best times and have forgotten others, and vice versa. I can remember that I had quite a bit of fun during the late eighties, but the vast majority of the detail is gone. When I've written down decade-old memories and looked at them a decade after that, it really, really often happens that I'm disturbed at how differently I remembered that event when I was halfway closer to it than now. Human memory is so sketchy and malleable that it's just barely useful at all. :(

    Hi, thanks for that detailed comment and all the resources you linked! It'll take some time to look at all of them and transfer your knowledge to this project.
    So I'm focused on developing Frontends, but I asked a friend who is very strong in building backends. We agreed that we have to try to develop a modern version org-mode with all the features we need.
    Something like [https://remotestorage.io/](https://remotestorage.io/)  what [kureshii](https://www.reddit.com/user/kureshii/) mentioned. The base idea is to build a system based on Microservices which will be specialized in certain tasks, like file formats. But all of the services will be available through one unified API. And everybody can decide how they want to consume the data, we'll provide a JS Client Side Libary. E.g. I want a dedicated Notes and ToDo app, but also something an app to organize projects where I can See notes and todo lists in relation to a project. And due to the fact that everything will be Open Source everybody can build their own Microservice, eg to add a service to make iCloud files available.
    And it'll be easy to set up because everything will be dockerized and hopefully up with only one command. And maybe in the long term we can think about a hosted version because I think that should be service everybody not only IT people should use. Yes, you lose the freedom to have everything on the server you want, but at least you have a centralized backup of all your data. And one of our focus topics will be an easy export function as markdown and if you want you could automize this to a 3rd party solution. But that's a long way to go :)
    Due to the interest, I created a new Twitter account: [https://twitter.com/The\_Minerva\_](https://twitter.com/The_Minerva_)  and already a GitHub Org [https://github.com/Minerva-Development](https://github.com/Minerva-Development) .
    I would be happy if we could stay in contact :)
    Thank you!
    
    PS: Yes we may reinvent the wheel, but we'll use what is already there, at least concepts and specs :)

<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21659876>  

    What I see missing is an ecosystem of interoperable tools.
    It would be great if I could have a location/format in which all my digital knowledge is stored. And then be able to use different tools which support multiple processes/flows:
    
    - a flow for discovering content
    - a flow for archiving the highlights I take on the web
    - a flow for writing notes
    
    it would be great if I could change any tool while keeping the flow intact.
    The only thing that somehow mirrors this is Evernote + Readwise + IFTT. There are tons of integrations that allow you to populate Evernote from tweets, Highly, Kindle highlights, etc. What I would love is if I could easily swap Evernote with any other editor (e.g. Bear) without changing much.
    I wouldn't mind paying for these tools I would just like this personal knowledge software to work in a way in which you can natively add blocks/functionality to it. Most of them have huger vendor lock in.

interesting approah; "content discovery flow" seems like a good post title?  




# <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21653923>       [[pkm]] [[annotation]]

    Yes, this siloing stops me from using annotation features "native" to each app and format as such as well.
    Instead, I prefer to exfiltrate information from the silos(apps, formats, etc) and put them into my note taking system. Then I can do highlights, annotations, etc. on my own terms and also get the benefits of centralization such as searching and linking(the OP has another post describing their own system, which is pretty cool[1]). Currently I'm using Notion, which is also a silo of its own, but it's one that gives me a lot of control over how I lay my information out(and an escape plan from).
    There are a lot of perspectives on this issue with data silos and walled gardens. But I'm of the opinion that it's a fairly bad state for all of us "end users". Computers to me are about infinite flexibility and malleability, but ironically the tools we have for annotation and remixing are in practice worse than what we have in the physical world. Reading a book in the physical world, I can converse with the author simply by jotting marginalia with my pencil. It's fluid, intuitive, and the medium of paper encourages it(in fact it can't help but be mutated by my use!: pages get bended, stained, torn, etc.). If I want to go further I can add post-it notes to mark interesting passages, I can xerox some pages and create subsections, if it's a magazine I can just tear them all out! That kind of flexibility just isn't available on a computer.
    I think it's worth thinking really hard why we're in this state, especially since computing pioneers were actually very optimistic that data and computing would be way more personally malleable than it is now(I've been working on a small comic on this theme myself[2]). For example, check out this short demo[3] of Smalltalk where Alan Kay hooks up a single frame from an animation of a bouncing ball to a painting program, to modify that one frame while also monitoring the loop. Smarter than paper, but way more flexible.

    Agree with your sentiment. Contextuality and Applicability are definitely two main components when it comes to knowledge acquisition. But there are people who just derive pleasure from learning, irrespective of whether the concepts are connected or disjoint, and I think it is very important that we have all variety of people, and encourage them into pursuing what gives them satisfaction.

    The problem (IMHO) around notes, scheduling, and productivity apps is that they have only subset of features that a given user needs. User workflows are very unique and diverse. Some may prefer calendar integration, some may not. Others may prefer inline image support while some only require text. The examples are endless. It seems inevitable that a note/scheduling/productivity app can only bloat user experience while being in the infinite race to onboard features their users/competitors demand.
