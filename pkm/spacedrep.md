Spaced repetition lets you memorize things with very small (or to be more precise, pretty passive) cognitive effort.  

Personally I haven't paid much attention to specific algorithms and formulas. There is some research out there claiming superiority of one over another, but I feel like as long as it's exponential backoff, that works for me.

    @alexeyguzey I used to use spaced repetition for productivity tricks, so I could remember to apply them

# -------------------------------------- 




# content 

-   spaced repetition
-   memrise
-   duolinguo
-   anki
-   org-drill
-   capturing new habits is super easy (in terms of remembering, not willpower)

some good advice about spaced repetition

# Try spaced repetition for stuff from hypothesis and instapaper. Or even books in general      [[spacedrep]]

could also use timeline for that&#x2026;  
especially now that I got intermediate representation? I could even load it up as an always running server!

    Here's the distribution of time people spend reviewing cards at https://t.co/QbN9qttrGe.  The median time is about 6 seconds. The _average_ time is almost twice as long, at 11 seconds! https://t.co/dGTDfsTxg8

# `[2017-11-01]` anki vs supermemo      [[spacedrep]]

    Basically what you have said. Everything are disadvantages but maybe the algorithm. However, I think Anki's algorithm is based on Supermemo's algorithm, it is just that it is not based on the most recent but Anki's and Supermemo's are very similar. There is no reason why someone would use Supermemo instead of Anki. All that said, I use Supermemo and Anki, because I think the few free decks for languages Supermemo have are quite great and there is no way to export them so I use Supermemo with some of these decks but Anki for everything else.

### `[2018-04-17]` UPD: org-habits




## memrise app for learning German




## org drill

-   ok, it's pretty nice, plaintext
-   keyboard
-   unclear where to find decks
-   no mobile app
-   no images

    @michael_nielsen The analogy of supervised learning and spaced repetition I think is dead on. I've been referring to Polar as a "cognitive prosthetic".  My background is partly in machine learning so when I got into spacedrepetition I immediately realized it was supervised learning for humans.

# Spaced repetition apps      [[spacedrep]]

-   AnkiDroid &#x2013; kinda ok
-   duolinguo: spaced repetition for language learning  
    weird, goes straight into grammar, doesn't really explain anything, synthesised voice
-   memrise: spaced repetition for language learning  
    ok, good progress, but feels too easy occasionally, weird exercise suggestions sometimes.
-   using org-drill after all
