    This options control which external binary tar calls for compressing its data stream: lzma and xz respectively. While both of them uses the same compression algorithm by default, xz is considered more up-to-date and feature rich, with lzma being somewhat legacy tool. Modern version of xz-utils provides both commands, with lzma being an 'alias' for xz --format=lzma (man xz).

    Not great, you can only officially export PDF, PNG, or SVG, though their cloud management does seem to work really well and as I understand, files are stored locally on each device once synced.
    That said, it runs linux so you could conceivably backup the files yourself. You can ssh into your tablet, run sftp, w/e. But they are in some proprietary .lines format.

    You know, because we knew this would be controversial we made sure it was both a compile-time option and a runtime option. Yes the upstream default of both defaults to on, but that's just upstream. We made it very easy and supported for downstream distros to switch between opt-out and opt-in of this option for their users. We have encouraged distributions to leave it on, but we were fully aware that for compatibility reasons this is something downstreams likely wanted to turn off, and most compat-minded distros did, as we expected.
    
    Now I am used to taking blame for apparently everything that every went wrong on Linux, but you might as well blame your downstream distros for this as much you want to blame us upstream about this, as it's up to them to pick the right compile-time options matching their userbase and requirements in compatibility, and if they didn't do that to your liking, then maybe you should complain to them first.
    
    (And yes, I still consider it a weakness of UNIX that "logout" doesn't really mean "logout", but just "maybe, please, if you'd be so kind, i'd like to exit, but not quite". I mean, that's not how you build a secure system. We fixed that really, fully knowing it would depart from UNIX tradition, but that's why we made it both compile-time and runtime configurable)

    Koreader is probably the best thing to happen to e-ink devices since sliced bread. It replaces the need to use any cables with an e-reader; since newer versions have a nice SSH server, and can also update itself.

    Guix is definitely a cleaner implementation (coherent cli tooling, way better manual, not a custom, oddball language, ...).
    But:
    * if Nix is already very niche, Guix is the niche of a niche. The ecosystem is tiny in comparison.
    * The Nix interpreter isn't exactly fast, but Guix (with it's scheme) was significantly worse for me, even in relatively small tests
    * The hard stance on open source requirements is understandable, given the projects origin, but it will severely hinder adoption. No, I don't want to package every commercial app I need myself. nixpkgs has almost everything.

ok, really good guide  

-   update remarkable
-   ssh onto it
-   follow toltec install <https://github.com/toltec-dev/toltec#install-it>
-   opkg install rm2fb
-   opkg install remux  # launcher  
    systemctl enable &#x2013;now remux  
    swipe up (on the right edge!), should show the menu
-   opkg install koreader
-   Create a file *home/root*.config/draft/02-koreader with the following contents  
    not sure if really that necessary?  
    
        name=koreader
        desc=Ebook reader
        call=/opt/koreader/koreader.sh
        term=;
-   congratulations, you are done!

    Note that when a ReMarkable system update occurs you will likely need to re-run the systemctl enable --now remux command. I think this should be the only command needed to re-run, but I don’t have a system update to install to validate that.

    HOW DO I RENAME/MOVE A SYNCED FOLDER?An alternative way is to shut down Syncthing, move the folder on disk (including the .stfolder marker), edit the path directly in config.xml in the configuration folder (see config) and then start Syncthing again.

ok this works great
