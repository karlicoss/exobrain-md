# `[2018-07-12]` dreem band?      [[eeg]]

Dreem is the closest thing I've seen. It's slick but it's a bit pricier than the Zeo, $500.  
<https://dreem.com/en/technology>  
<https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/8dn6tw/dreem_headband_initial_thoughts/>  
eh, 499 usd??  




## eeg, accelerometer, breathing, pulse oxymeter




## <https://blog.dreem.com/en/meditate-with-dreem-and-fall-asleep-more-easily/> hmmm




## eh, mixed reviews

<https://gizmodo.com/this-smart-headband-was-supposed-to-help-me-sleep-bette-1822568894> this one is quite bitter  




# ResMed S + monitor

<http://wheresmycreditcard.com/s-resmed-personal-sleep-solution/>  
err.. contactless so how the fuck it detects hr??? <https://www.resmed.com/us/en/consumer/s-plus.html>  
<https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/5vyg0u/resmed_s_vs_beddit_30/>  




# beddit &#x2013; works by ballistography

Accessing the Raw Data  
Beddit has a feature to download raw data to a spreadsheet, which can be very useful for doing any detailed analysis. It even gives more advanced metrics like overnight Heart Rate Variability (HRV).  

Beddit also has an API to access data, but currently only available for companies or research teams.  

Compared to high-end sensors on the market (Emfit QS, ResMed S+), the Beddit stands up well.  




# Withings Aura &#x2013; apparently old version of nokia sleep




# Sense &#x2013; shut down




# zeo &#x2013; went bust..      [[eeg]]

I wish ResMed would make a new one. They bought up all the intellectual property from Zeo. Instead, they put out their useless contactless tracker and sat on the Zeo tech.  
I use the Zeo mobile. You can still find it and the larger units on ebay.  




# buy jawbone again? at least it measured something&#x2026;      [[jawbone]] [[qs]]

right, jawbone is liquidating, so guess not worth buying now  
jawbone3 didn't even connect to my phone properly  
nokia sleep? (igor shilov)  
maybe beddit? Can't find good reviews though.
