Why? It's fun (at least subjectively).  
I'm trying to work on objectively useful things (diet, exercise, sleep), and quantifying keeps me motivated to to more research and get rigorous understanding of how body works.  

About the data I collect: <https://beepb00p.xyz/my-data.html>  




# tracking: #sleep

need to update this section properly  
at the moment I'm using Emfit QS for actual data, and manual org-mode tracking for subjective stats after sleep  




## UP24 bioimpedance





### actually take a look at intervals after all! Maybe prot on one large picture?




## zeo band? apparently, went bust..

see gwern blog  




## how to assess quality of sleep properly??




## <https://sleepjunkies.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-sleep-tracking/> 




## dreams: just org-mode





### oneiroarium? 




# tracking: #location

-   google maps
-   swarm




# tracking: #mood




# tracking: #blood

-   medichecks
-   thriva




# tracking: #weight





## in particular, body composition





### bioimpedance? 

apparently, not very precise, fluctuates a lot depending on water intake  




# tracking: finances

### <https://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/5o4cyb/emsk_about_an_app_called_quality_time_to_keep/dchj19y> 

    I tried this app for several weeks but gave up because it was blatantly inaccurate. It will log time of apps running in the background. When I had two browser windows opened it would double my time assuming I was looking at both windows simultaneously.
    The one thing it did well was count how many times you unlock the phone, which surprised me I checked it as often as I did, but I was pretty sure I didn't play candy crush for 6 hours straight while I was sleeping. [reddit]




# tracking: misc





## blood pressure?




## alcohol monitor?

    The only way to get an accurate reading of your BAC is with a blood draw. The PBTs the police use on the side of the road are wildly inaccurate, and even the more advanced ones they use at the police stations/car breathalyzers still have their problems with calibration.
    I doubt one you can buy at a store is going to be accurate at all, so my advice would be not to waste your money.




## thyroid home test?




## cholesterol home test?




## gut biome? <https://ubiome.com>




## food Intolerance tests

<https://www.testmyintolerance.com/product/advanced-intolerance-test/>  
meh, unlikely it would show anything useful

A bit insane (or is it?). But worth going through the biomarkers tests, etc, might be something useful there

    The results can be correlated with VO2 Max.
