# Copenhagen/Malmo       [[denmark]] [[copenhagen]]

-   Buy Rejsekort, makes it easy to travel around Denmark and you can go to Malmo with it. Mind that it needs some minimal balance (70 DKK as of writing), and bus stops often lack the top-up machine.
-   If you go to Malmo, make sure to take your passport if you're not an EU citizen, there is border control on Swedish side
-   Christiania is a bit overrated, just bunch of people who smoke weed
-   [Louisiana Museum of Modern Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Museum_of_Modern_Art): a bit too small considering how far it is from the city center. However, first museum to have couple of nude art pieces I actually liked.
-   [Bodyworlds](https://bodyworlds.com/city/copenhagen) exhibition at [Experimentarium](https://www.experimentarium.dk/en): cool models and presentations of different layers of human bodies, tissue, organs etc
-   [Disgusting Food Museum](https://disgustingfoodmuseum.com/sweden) in Malmo: pure awesomeness. Glimpse into different food cultures, lots of things to smell and touch, and even tasting bar! Also funny how my taste perception changed over the past few years: I didn't find cheese smells disgusting at all.




# Portugal       [[portugal]]





## Lisbon       [[lisbon]]



### transport 

-   Airport  
    We were leaving Monday 7pm and the line for border control was ridiculous, only one out of ten booths was operational, even though the whole queue had to depart in 20 minutes. So you might really want to arrive in advance.
-   Uber from airport: very cheap to city center, 8 euros.
-   LisboaCard: apparently not very good value for money unless you're planning visiting museums a lot [wikitravel].
-   Lisboa Viva Card get it at metro/train stations. Use it for buses, ferry, metro, suburban trains, etc.
-   I've read advice to avoid the metro late at night somewhere on reddit, but can't confirm


### food/drinks 


-   Drinking/smoking in public — OK as long as you behave.

-   Get a wine and snacks from a supermarket. Chill on the river bank, beware the waves, they might suddenly splash you!

-   Francesinha

    some authentic sandwich?  

-   Fish/squid/octopus. Many small restaurants serve it + veggie plates

-   Caldeirada seafood stew

    haven't had chance to try&#x2026; but heard it was good  

-   TimeOut market for food. Lines are pretty long at lunchtime. Not very cheap and not very authentic, but ok overall.

-   Trobadores medieval tavern

    Very cool place! Looks very medieval, nice Celtic musing on the background.  
    Order chorizo/blood chorizo, you can grill it yourself right on your table!  
    Nice Celtic musing in the background.  
    Drink mead, ginjinha, Porto ruby.  

-   Pastel de nata. Nice egg pastry.

-   Gelaterias. Some delicious ice cream: vanilla & basil, salted caramel, pistachio.

-   Chimera Brewpub.

    Craft Portuguese Beers  

-   Nice filter coffee in Copenhagen Coffee Lab (beware no wifi) and Fabrica Coffee Roasters


### places & activities


-   Berardo Collection Museum &#x2013; good modern art

-   Alfama is higher up and more medieval looking because a tsunami destroyed the lower elevation parts of the city. [wikitravel]

-   [Sintra](https://wikitravel.org/en/Sintra)

    You can get there by cheap (1.5 Eur) suburban train.  
    
    Sintra is famous for two local foodstuffs, queijadas and travesseiros. Queijadas are small sweet cakes, that are made using fresh cheese instead of butter. They are actually quite easy to make at home, but when you're there you might as well try some. Travesseiros are rectangular pastries made from fluff pastry and almond paste, and worth a try as well. [wikitravel]  
    
    -   Cabo de Rocha - very nice lighthouse, cliffs, and decent hike to the beach.
    
        Take a bus from Sintra, but beware the way is serpentinish, in case you are prone to motion sickness. It costs something like 4 EUR, paid by cash to the driver. Also mind the schedule.  

-   de abril bridge

    Very cool, looks kinda like Golden Gate. Unfortunately not pedestrian.  

-   take a ferry to the other side, walk to Christ the King statue. Nice city view

-   train to cascais (coastal resort)

-   For Lisbon views, we preferred the Rua Augusta arch over the more popular Santa Justa elevator. The arch is also covered by the Lisboa card (€2.50 otherwise) and is IMO the cheaper and better alternative for some superb views of the city. [wikitravel]

-   electricity museum

-   Art in metro on some stations

    Mostly [red line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Line_(Lisbon_Metro)). It goes to the airport, so it's hard to miss. Oriente is particularly cool  

-   Jardim Botanico

    allegedly good, but was closed at the time :(  




## Faro, Portugal? when it's colder, maybe in autumn/winter




## Porto       [[porto]]



### `[2019-04-05]` [Geres National Park](https://wikitravel.org/en/Porto)

    Go on a day trip to the Gerês National Park. The wildlife and nature in this park are really worth a visit, and the scenery is magnificent.


### `[2019-04-05]` [Vunho Verde](https://wikitravel.org/en/Porto)

    Taste the "Vinho Verde", freely translated as "Green Wine" - this is mostly a low alcoholic grade, young and fresh kind of wine, that you won't find anywhere else.




# Istanbul       [[turkey]] [[istanbul]]

-   `[2016-08-22]` "Если хотите ощутить турецкий колорит, а не туристический булшит, приезжайте в Кадыкёй, поешьте кебаб за столиком на улице, курите кальян."




# Helsinki       [[finland]] [[helsinki]]

-   subway
-   2/3 tram

-   Senate Square
-   Helsinki City Museum
-   Helsinki Nykytaiteen museo Kiasma
-   Vintage tram ride, Havis Amanda fountain at Market square  
    
        Enjoy a ride on a century-old tram! If the weather is warm, sit in the open trailer car. The driver takes you on a 20-minute loop tour around the city centre area (there is no commentary but photo opportunities are plenty due to there being no windows in the open tram from 1909!). The service operates annually from mid-May to the end of August, Saturdays and Sundays only, with departures from the Market Square half-hourly between 10 and 5. €5.  edit
-   Aleksanterinkatu
-   Kallio bars




# Netherlands       [[netherlands]]





## moving around

trains are pretty great, and if you're going often, makes sense to buy a permanent travelcard  

-   NS planner works better than citymapper/gmaps <https://www.ns.nl/en/journeyplanner>  
    their app is ok as well <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.ns.android.activity>




## activities 



### take bikes

Mind the sun. You're probably better off biking in the morning, waiting till the evening and going back when it's cooler.  


### swim <http://www.zwemwater.nl>

North sea is actually not that cold, you can totally tolerate few dips.  
Coast could be very shallow though (e.g Zandvoort), so mind the waves.  




## misc 

-   take cash or Maestro card  
    Many places don't take visa/mastercard. Most supermarket on train stations do though.




## Amsterdam       [[amsterdam]]



### `[2018-05-27]` Van der Linde <https://goo.gl/maps/pawDXa2wL4y>

    Nieuwendijk 183, 1012 MG Amsterdam, Netherlands

best vanilla ice cream ever  


### Van Goth museum

very decent, you're better off buying tickets online couple of days in advance  


### microbes museum


### `[2018-05-27]` Tijger & de Vis <https://goo.gl/maps/1eVeg9DmQG52>

    Lindengracht 158, 1015 KK Amsterdam, Netherlands

-   nice seafood plate
-   check out the restroom




## Maastricht? 

Could be ok by Eurostar and local train?  




## Hague 



### Escher museum

amazing, highly recommended. check out the souvenir shop, awesome postcards.  




## Rotterdam 




# Germany       [[germany]]





## Berlin 



### techno bars      [[music]]

    техно-бары, если кому интересно: Minimal bar, Süß war gestern. оба во фридрихсхайне, в обоих диджеи каждый день, и иногда очень приличные, нет фейсконтроля в отличие от клубов, а потанцевать можно не хуже (в süß вход платный после 11). еще хвалят burg schnabel и crack bellmer


### `[2018-03-11]` line U2 overground/underground


### `[2018-03-12]` Berlinische galerie &#x2013; ok but not super interesting


### `[2018-02-06]` <https://twitter.com/abroadunderhood/status/960804558996897792>      [[berlin]]

    Вообще есть автобус номер 100, он проезжает по всем основным точкам центрального Берлина и считается туристическим, только стоит нормальные 2,80 вместо 10), ходит к слову тоже каждые десять минут.


### `[2018-03-13]` Museum of technology – meh, not really worth it




# Italy       [[italy]]





## food 



### `[2018-06-06]` burrata cheese

Very very good! Especially with some berries.  


### `[2018-06-07]` Grom good gelato


### `[2018-06-06]` coda alla vaccinara

well - sort of ok  




## Santa Marinella beach

-   <https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g815431-i17388-k6466314-Info_for_those_travelling_from_Rome_to_Santa_Marinella-Santa_Marinella_Province_of_Rome_La.html>
-   <https://www.eatingitalyfoodtours.com/blog/a-day-trip-to-santa-marinella-beach/>
-   <https://revealedrome.com/2011/05/beach-in-rome-santa-marinella-italy/>

    Secondly, Santa Marinella’s beach is convenient. Really convenient. You don’t need a car to get there, or to take a train and then a bus, like you do to get to the (admittedly prettier) beach of Sperlonga. Instead, you just hop on the train in Rome from Termini, Ostiense, Trastevere, or San Pietro; 45 minutes and €3.60 land you in Santa Marinella. From there, you can follow the crowds on the 5-minute walk to the beach.

-   eh, wasn't that good in the end




# Barcelona       [[barcelona]]

    very crowded, you might have to reserve or wait  

-   mary milk bar

    -   chocolate was too sweet




## Lake District

        Make sure you have the right equipment for a winter ascent including waterproofs, warm layers, hat & gloves, winter boots, ice axe & crampons, map & compass, head torch, food & drink and an emergency shelter. Goggles can be very useful on windy days. Pick a good day, but be prepared to turn back if you’re not happy with anything. If you’re new to the winter environment or would like a refresher then consider booking onto one of our one day Winter Skills courses.

    -   `[2020-08-30]` [Helvellyn Safety — Live for the Outdoors](https://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/helvellyn-safety)  
        
            Check the current conditions. Helvellyn is unique in that it has a daily update throughout winter provided by the Lake District Weatherline (www.lakedistrictweatherline.co.uk) This gives an excellent indication as to what weather conditions are like at the top of the mountain over the past 24 hours, and is invaluable when planning an ascent. Also check the forecasts via the Mountain Weather Information Service (MWIS.org.uk) and the Met Office mountain weather forecast.  https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/mountain
    -   `[2020-08-30]` [Helvellyn Safety — Live for the Outdoors](https://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/helvellyn-safety)  
        
            Pack a headtorch, and a spare, plus extra layers for when it gets dark.

### `[2018-04-18]` <https://twitter.com/abroadunderhood/status/986632898685145089>

    Пробежимся немного по ночной жизни Тбилиси: здесь с этим все более чем хорошо, потому что грузины любят и умеют веселиться. Для любителей техно тут есть клуб Bassiani, который входит в топ 10 техно-клубов мира. Еще есть khidi (мост) и Mtkvarze. Пожалуй, это самые популярные клубы
